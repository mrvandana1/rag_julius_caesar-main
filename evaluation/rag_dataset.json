    "question": "How does Caesar first enter the play?",
    "contexts": [
      "Enter Caesar, Antony for the course, Calphurnia, Portia, Decius, Cicero, Brutus, Cassius, Casca, a Soothsayer; after them Marullus and Flavius and Commoners. Calphurnia. Peace, ho! Caesar speaks. Calphurnia. Here, my lord. Stand you directly in Antonius’ way When he doth run his course.—Antonius. Caesar, my lord. Forget not in your speed, Antonius, To touch Calphurnia, for our elders say The barren, touchèd in this holy chase, Shake off their sterile curse. I shall remember. When Caesar says “Do this,” it is performed. Set on and leave no ceremony out. Sennet. Caesar. Ha! Who calls? Bid every noise be still. Peace, yet again! Who is it in the press that calls on me? I hear a tongue shriller than all the music Cry “Caesar.” Speak. Caesar is turned to hear. Beware the ides of March. What man is that? A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March. Set him before me. Let me see his face. Fellow, come from the throng. The Soothsayer comes forward. Look upon Caesar. What sayst thou to me now? Speak once again. Beware the ides of March. He is a dreamer. Let us leave him. Pass. Sennet. All but Brutus and Cassius exit. Will you go see the order of the course? Not I. I pray you, do. I am not gamesome. I do lack some part Of that quick spirit that is in Antony. Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires. I’ll leave you. Brutus, I do observe you now of late. I have not from your eyes that gentleness And show of love as I was wont to have. You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand Over your friend that loves you. Cassius, Be not deceived. If I have veiled my look, I turn the trouble of my countenance Merely upon myself. Vexèd I am Of late with passions of some difference, Conceptions only proper to myself, Which give some soil, perhaps, to my behaviors. But let not therefore my good friends be grieved (Among which number, Cassius, be you one) Nor construe any further my neglect Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war, Forgets the shows of love to other men. Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion, By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations. Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face? No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself But by reflection, by some other things. ’Tis just. And it is very much lamented, Brutus, That you have no such mirrors as will turn Your hidden worthiness into your eye, That you might see your shadow. I have heard Where many of the best respect in Rome, Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus And groaning underneath this age’s yoke, Have wished that noble Brutus had his eyes. Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius, That you would have me seek into myself For that which is not in me? Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear. And since you know you cannot see yourself So well as by reflection, I, your glass, Will modestly discover to yourself That of yourself which you yet know not of. And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus. Were I a common laughter, or did use To stale with ordinary oaths my love To every new protester; if you know That I do fawn on men and hug them hard And after scandal them, or if you know That I profess myself in banqueting To all the rout, then hold me dangerous. Flourish and shout. What means this shouting? I do fear the people Choose Caesar for their king. Ay, do you fear it? Then must I think you would not have it so. I would not, Cassius, yet I love him well. But wherefore do you hold me here so long? What is it that you would impart to me? If it be aught toward the general good, Set honor in one eye and death i’ th’ other And I will look on both indifferently; For let the gods so speed me as I love The name of honor more than I fear death. I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus, As well as I do know your outward favor. Well, honor is the subject of my story. I cannot tell what you and other men Think of this life; but, for my single self, I had as lief not be as live to be In awe of such a thing as I myself. I was born free as Caesar; so were you; We both have fed as well, and we can both Endure the winter’s cold as well as he. For once, upon a raw and gusty day, The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores, Caesar said to me “Dar’st thou, Cassius, now Leap in with me into this angry flood And swim to yonder point?” Upon the word, Accoutered as I was, I plungèd in And bade him follow; so indeed he did. The torrent roared, and we did buffet it With lusty sinews, throwing it aside And stemming it with hearts of controversy. But ere we could arrive the point proposed, Caesar cried “Help me, Cassius, or I sink!” as Aeneas, our great ancestor, Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber Did I the tired Caesar. And this man Is now become a god, and Cassius is A wretched creature and must bend his body If Caesar carelessly but nod on him. He had a fever when he was in Spain, And when the fit was on him, I did mark How he did shake. ’Tis true, this god did shake. His coward lips did from their color fly, And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world Did lose his luster. I did hear him groan. Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans Mark him and write his speeches in their books, “Alas,” it cried “Give me some drink, Titinius” As a sick girl. You gods, it doth amaze me A man of such a feeble temper should So get the start of the majestic world And bear the palm alone. Shout. Flourish. Another general shout! I do believe that these applauses are For some new honors that are heaped on Caesar. Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world Like a Colossus, and we petty men Walk under his huge legs and peep about To find ourselves dishonorable graves. Men at some time are masters of their fates. The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, But in ourselves, that we are underlings. “Brutus” and “Caesar”—what should be in that “Caesar”? Why should that name be sounded more than yours? Write them together, yours is as fair a name; Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well; Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with ’em, “Brutus” will start a spirit as soon as “Caesar.” Now, in the names of all the gods at once, Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed! Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods! When went there by an age, since the great flood, But it was famed with more than with one man? When could they say, till now, that talked of Rome, That her wide walks encompassed but one man? Now is it Rome indeed, and room enough When there is in it but one only man. you and I have heard our fathers say There was a Brutus once that would have brooked Th’ eternal devil to keep his state in Rome As easily as a king. That you do love me, I am nothing jealous. What you would work me to, I have some aim. How I have thought of this, and of these times, I shall recount hereafter. For this present, I would not, so with love I might entreat you, Be any further moved. What you have said I will consider; what you have to say I will with patience hear, and find a time Both meet to hear and answer such high things. Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this: Brutus had rather be a villager Than to repute himself a son of Rome Under these hard conditions as this time Is like to lay upon us. I am glad that my weak words Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus. Enter Caesar and his train. The games are done, and Caesar is returning. As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve, And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you What hath proceeded worthy note today. I will do so. But look you, Cassius, The angry spot doth glow on Caesar’s brow, And all the rest look like a chidden train. Calphurnia’s cheek is pale, and Cicero Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes As we have seen him in the Capitol, Being crossed in conference by some senators. Casca will tell us what the matter is. Antonius. Caesar. Let me have men about me that are fat, Sleek-headed men, and such as sleep a-nights. Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look. He thinks too much. Such men are dangerous. Fear him not, Caesar; he’s not dangerous. He is a noble Roman, and well given. Would he were fatter! But I fear him not. Yet if my name were liable to fear, I do not know the man I should avoid So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much, He is a great observer, and he looks Quite through the deeds of men. He loves no plays, As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music; Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort As if he mocked himself and scorned his spirit That could be moved to smile at anything. Such men as he be never at heart’s ease Whiles they behold a greater than themselves, And therefore are they very dangerous. I rather tell thee what is to be feared Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar. Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf, And tell me truly what thou think’st of him. Sennet. Caesar and his train exit but Casca remains behind. You pulled me by the cloak. Would you speak with me? Ay, Casca. Tell us what hath chanced today That Caesar looks so sad. Why, you were with him, were you not? I should not then ask Casca what had chanced. Why, there was a crown offered him; and, being offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand, thus, and then the people fell a-shouting. What was the second noise for? Why, for that too. They shouted thrice. What was the last cry for? Why, for that too. Was the crown offered him thrice? Ay, marry, was ’t, and he put it by thrice, every time gentler than other; and at every putting-by, mine honest neighbors shouted. Who offered him the crown? Why, Antony. Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca. I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it. It was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown (yet ’twas not a crown neither; ’twas one of these coronets), and, as I told you, he put it by once; but for all that, to my thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he offered it to him again; then he put it by again; but to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it. And then he offered it the third time. He put it the third time by, and still as he refused it the rabblement hooted and clapped their chopped hands and threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked Caesar, for he swooned and fell down at it. And for mine own part, I durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air. But soft, I pray you. What, did Caesar swoon? He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and was speechless. ’Tis very like; he hath the falling sickness. No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness. I know not what you mean by that, but I am sure Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and displeased them, as they use to do the players in the theater, I am no true man. What said he when he came unto himself? Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common herd was glad he refused the crown, he plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his throat to cut. An I had been a man of any occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word, I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so he fell. When he came to himself again, he said if he had done or said anything amiss, he desired their Worships to think it was his infirmity. Three or four wenches where I stood cried “Alas, good soul!” and forgave him with all their hearts. But there’s no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less. And, after that, he came thus sad away? Ay. Did Cicero say anything? Ay, he spoke Greek. To what effect? Nay, an I tell you that, I’ll ne’er look you i’ th’ face again. But those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads. But for mine own part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarves off Caesar’s images, are put to silence. Fare you well. There was more foolery yet, if I could remember it. Will you sup with me tonight, Casca? No, I am promised forth. Will you dine with me tomorrow? Ay, if I be alive, and your mind hold, and your dinner worth the eating. Good. I will expect you. Do so. Farewell both. He exits. What a blunt fellow is this grown to be! He was quick mettle when he went to school. So is he now in execution Of any bold or noble enterprise, However he puts on this tardy form. This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit, Which gives men stomach to digest his words With better appetite. And so it is. For this time I will leave you. Tomorrow, if you please to speak with me, I will come home to you; or, if you will, Come home to me, and I will wait for you. I will do so. Till then, think of the world. Brutus exits. Well, Brutus, thou art noble. Yet I see Thy honorable mettle may be wrought From that it is disposed. Therefore it is meet That noble minds keep ever with their likes; For who so firm that cannot be seduced? Caesar doth bear me hard, but he loves Brutus. If I were Brutus now, and he were Cassius, He should not humor me. I will this night In several hands in at his windows throw, As if they came from several citizens, Writings, all tending to the great opinion That Rome holds of his name, wherein obscurely Caesar’s ambition shall be glancèd at And after this, let Caesar seat him sure, For we will shake him, or worse days endure. He exits.",
      "Flourish. Enter Caesar, Antony, Lepidus; Brutus, Cassius, Casca, Decius, Metellus, Trebonius, Cinna; Publius, Popilius, Artemidorus, the Soothsayer, and other Senators and Petitioners. The ides of March are come. SOOTHSAYER Ay, Caesar, but not gone. ARTEMIDORUS Hail, Caesar. Read this schedule. Trebonius doth desire you to o’erread, At your best leisure, this his humble suit. O Caesar, read mine first, for mine’s a suit That touches Caesar nearer. Read it, great Caesar. What touches us ourself shall be last served. Delay not, Caesar; read it instantly. What, is the fellow mad? Sirrah, give place. What, urge you your petitions in the street? Come to the Capitol. Caesar goes forward, the rest following. to Cassius I wish your enterprise today may thrive. What enterprise, Popilius? Fare you well. He walks away. What said Popilius Lena? He wished today our enterprise might thrive. I fear our purpose is discoverèd. Look how he makes to Caesar. Mark him. Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention.— Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known, Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back, For I will slay myself. Cassius, be constant. Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes, For look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change. Trebonius knows his time, for look you, Brutus, He draws Mark Antony out of the way. Trebonius and Antony exit. Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him go And presently prefer his suit to Caesar. He is addressed. Press near and second him. Casca, you are the first that rears your hand. Are we all ready? What is now amiss That Caesar and his Senate must redress? kneeling Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar, Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat An humble heart. I must prevent thee, Cimber. These couchings and these lowly courtesies Might fire the blood of ordinary men And turn preordinance and first decree Into the law of children. Be not fond To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood That will be thawed from the true quality With that which melteth fools—I mean sweet words, Low-crookèd curtsies, and base spaniel fawning. Thy brother by decree is banishèd. If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him, I spurn thee like a cur out of my way. Know: Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause Will he be satisfied. Is there no voice more worthy than my own To sound more sweetly in great Caesar’s ear For the repealing of my banished brother? kneeling I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar, Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may Have an immediate freedom of repeal. What, Brutus? kneeling Pardon, Caesar; Caesar, pardon! As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber. I could be well moved, if I were as you. If I could pray to move, prayers would move me. But I am constant as the Northern Star, Of whose true fixed and resting quality There is no fellow in the firmament. The skies are painted with unnumbered sparks; They are all fire, and every one doth shine. But there’s but one in all doth hold his place. So in the world: ’tis furnished well with men, And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive. Yet in the number I do know but one That unassailable holds on his rank, Unshaked of motion; and that I am he Let me a little show it, even in this: That I was constant Cimber should be banished And constant do remain to keep him so. kneeling O Caesar— Hence. Wilt thou lift up Olympus? kneeling Great Caesar— Doth not Brutus bootless kneel? Speak, hands, for me! As Casca strikes, the others rise up and stab Caesar. Et tu, Brutè?—Then fall, Caesar. He dies. Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead! Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets. Some to the common pulpits and cry out “Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement.” People and Senators, be not affrighted. Fly not; stand still. Ambition’s debt is paid. Go to the pulpit, Brutus. And Cassius too. Where’s Publius? Here, quite confounded with this mutiny. Stand fast together, lest some friend of Caesar’s Should chance— Talk not of standing.—Publius, good cheer. There is no harm intended to your person, Nor to no Roman else. So tell them, Publius. And leave us, Publius, lest that the people, Rushing on us, should do your age some mischief. Do so, and let no man abide this deed But we the doers. All but the Conspirators exit. Enter Trebonius. Where is Antony? TREBONIUS Fled to his house amazed. Men, wives, and children stare, cry out, and run As it were doomsday. BRUTUS Fates, we will know your pleasures. That we shall die we know; ’tis but the time, And drawing days out, that men stand upon. Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life Cuts off so many years of fearing death. Grant that, and then is death a benefit. So are we Caesar’s friends, that have abridged His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop, And let us bathe our hands in Caesar’s blood Up to the elbows and besmear our swords. Then walk we forth, even to the marketplace, And, waving our red weapons o’er our heads, Let’s all cry “Peace, freedom, and liberty!” Stoop then, and wash. They smear their hands and swords with Caesar’s blood. How many ages hence Shall this our lofty scene be acted over In states unborn and accents yet unknown! How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport, That now on Pompey’s basis lies along No worthier than the dust! So oft as that shall be, So often shall the knot of us be called The men that gave their country liberty. What, shall we forth? Ay, every man away. Brutus shall lead, and we will grace his heels With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome. Enter a Servant. Soft, who comes here? A friend of Antony’s. kneeling Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel. Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down, And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say: Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest; Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving. Say, I love Brutus, and I honor him; Say, I feared Caesar, honored him, and loved him. If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony May safely come to him and be resolved How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death, Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead So well as Brutus living, but will follow The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus Thorough the hazards of this untrod state With all true faith. So says my master Antony. Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman. I never thought him worse. Tell him, so please him come unto this place, He shall be satisfied and, by my honor, Depart untouched. I’ll fetch him presently. Servant exits. I know that we shall have him well to friend. I wish we may; but yet have I a mind That fears him much, and my misgiving still Falls shrewdly to the purpose. Enter Antony. But here comes Antony.—Welcome, Mark Antony! O mighty Caesar, dost thou lie so low? Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.— I know not, gentlemen, what you intend, Who else must be let blood, who else is rank. If I myself, there is no hour so fit As Caesar’s death’s hour, nor no instrument Of half that worth as those your swords made rich With the most noble blood of all this world. I do beseech you, if you bear me hard, Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke, Fulfill your pleasure. Live a thousand years, I shall not find myself so apt to die; No place will please me so, no mean of death, As here by Caesar, and by you cut off, The choice and master spirits of this age. O Antony, beg not your death of us! Though now we must appear bloody and cruel, As by our hands and this our present act You see we do, yet see you but our hands And this the bleeding business they have done. Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful; And pity to the general wrong of Rome (As fire drives out fire, so pity pity) Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part, To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony. Our arms in strength of malice, and our hearts Of brothers’ temper, do receive you in With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence. Your voice shall be as strong as any man’s In the disposing of new dignities. Only be patient till we have appeased The multitude, beside themselves with fear; And then we will deliver you the cause Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him, Have thus proceeded. I doubt not of your wisdom. Let each man render me his bloody hand. First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you.— Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand.— Now, Decius Brutus, yours;—now yours, Metellus;— Yours, Cinna;—and, my valiant Casca, yours;— Though last, not least in love, yours, good Trebonius.— Gentlemen all—alas, what shall I say? My credit now stands on such slippery ground That one of two bad ways you must conceit me, Either a coward or a flatterer.— That I did love thee, Caesar, O, ’tis true! If then thy spirit look upon us now, Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death To see thy Antony making his peace, Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes— Most noble!—in the presence of thy corpse? Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds, Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood, It would become me better than to close In terms of friendship with thine enemies. Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bayed, brave hart, Here didst thou fall, and here thy hunters stand Signed in thy spoil and crimsoned in thy Lethe. O world, thou wast the forest to this hart, And this indeed, O world, the heart of thee. How like a deer strucken by many princes Dost thou here lie! Mark Antony— Pardon me, Caius Cassius. The enemies of Caesar shall say this; Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty. I blame you not for praising Caesar so. But what compact mean you to have with us? Will you be pricked in number of our friends, Or shall we on and not depend on you? Therefore I took your hands, but was indeed Swayed from the point by looking down on Caesar. Friends am I with you all and love you all, Upon this hope, that you shall give me reasons Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous. Or else were this a savage spectacle. Our reasons are so full of good regard That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar, You should be satisfied. That’s all I seek; And am, moreover, suitor that I may Produce his body to the marketplace, And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend, Speak in the order of his funeral. You shall, Mark Antony. Brutus, a word with you. Aside to Brutus. You know not what you do. Do not consent That Antony speak in his funeral. Know you how much the people may be moved By that which he will utter? aside to Cassius By your pardon, I will myself into the pulpit first And show the reason of our Caesar’s death. What Antony shall speak I will protest He speaks by leave and by permission, And that we are contented Caesar shall Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies. It shall advantage more than do us wrong. aside to Brutus I know not what may fall. I like it not. Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar’s body. You shall not in your funeral speech blame us But speak all good you can devise of Caesar And say you do ’t by our permission, Else shall you not have any hand at all About his funeral. And you shall speak In the same pulpit whereto I am going, After my speech is ended. Be it so. I do desire no more. Prepare the body, then, and follow us. All but Antony exit. O pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth, That I am meek and gentle with these butchers. Thou art the ruins of the noblest man That ever livèd in the tide of times. Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood! Over thy wounds now do I prophesy (Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue) A curse shall light upon the limbs of men; Domestic fury and fierce civil strife Shall cumber all the parts of Italy; Blood and destruction shall be so in use And dreadful objects so familiar That mothers shall but smile when they behold Their infants quartered with the hands of war, All pity choked with custom of fell deeds; And Caesar’s spirit, ranging for revenge, With Ate by his side come hot from hell, Shall in these confines with a monarch’s voice Cry “Havoc!” and let slip the dogs of war, That this foul deed shall smell above the earth With carrion men groaning for burial. Enter Octavius’ Servant. You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not? do, Mark Antony. Caesar did write for him to come to Rome. He did receive his letters and is coming, And bid me say to you by word of mouth— O Caesar! Thy heart is big. Get thee apart and weep. Passion, I see, is catching, for mine eyes, Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine, Began to water. Is thy master coming? He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome. Post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced. Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome, No Rome of safety for Octavius yet. Hie hence and tell him so.—Yet stay awhile; Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corpse Into the marketplace. There shall I try, In my oration, how the people take The cruel issue of these bloody men, According to the which thou shalt discourse To young Octavius of the state of things. Lend me your hand. They exit with Caesar’s body.",
      "Brutus grapples with the moral implications of assassinating Caesar, acknowledging no personal animosity but fearing Caesar's potential for tyranny if crowned. The arrival of the letter and the conspirators intensifies his internal conflict, pushing him toward action despite his reservations. Brutus's struggle is further complicated by Portia's plea for his trust, highlighting the tension between his public duty and private life. Finally, Ligarius's arrival and immediate willingness to follow Brutus underscores Brutus's influence and the momentum of the conspiracy, setting the stage for the assassination.",
      "The scene reveals Cassius's manipulative nature as he exploits Brutus's internal conflict and concern for the \"general good\" to plant seeds of doubt about Caesar's ambition. Brutus, though initially resistant, is swayed by Cassius's flattery and appeals to his sense of honor, suggesting a vulnerability to persuasion that Cassius intends to exploit. Caesar's distrust of Cassius, voiced to Antony, highlights the political tension and foreshadows the conspiracy against him. Cassius's soliloquy at the end confirms his plan to manipulate Brutus further, indicating a calculated strategy to undermine Caesar's power.",

      "Enter Caesar, Antony for the course, Calphurnia, Portia, Decius, Cicero, Brutus, Cassius, Casca, a Soothsayer; after them Marullus and Flavius and Commoners. Calphurnia. Peace, ho! Caesar speaks. Calphurnia. Here, my lord. Stand you directly in Antonius’ way When he doth run his course.—Antonius. Caesar, my lord. Forget not in your speed, Antonius, To touch Calphurnia, for our elders say The barren, touchèd in this holy chase, Shake off their sterile curse. I shall remember. When Caesar says “Do this,” it is performed. Set on and leave no ceremony out. Sennet. Caesar. Ha! Who calls? Bid every noise be still. Peace, yet again! Who is it in the press that calls on me?

Set him before me. Let me see his face. Fellow, come from the throng. The Soothsayer comes forward. Look upon Caesar. What sayst thou to me now? Speak once again. Beware the ides of March. He is a dreamer. Let us leave him. Pass. Sennet. All but Brutus and Cassius exit. Will you go see the order of the course? Not I. I pray you, do. I am not gamesome. I do lack some part Of that quick spirit that is in Antony. Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires. I’ll leave you. Brutus, I do observe you now of late. I have not from your eyes that gentleness And show of love as I was wont to have. You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand Over your friend that loves you. Cassius, Be not deceived. If I have veiled my look, I turn the trouble of my countenance Merely upon myself. Vexèd I am Of late with passions of some difference, Conceptions only proper to myself, Which give some soil, perhaps, to my behaviors. But let not therefore my good friends be grieved (Among which number, Cassius, be you one) Nor construe any further my neglect Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war, Forgets the shows of love to other men. Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion, By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations. Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face? No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself But by reflection, by some other things. ’Tis just. And it is very much lamented, Brutus, That you have no such mirrors as will turn Your hidden worthiness into your eye, That you might see your shadow. I have heard Where many of the best respect in Rome, Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus And groaning underneath this age’s yoke, Have wished that noble Brutus had his eyes. Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius, That you would have me seek into myself For that which is not in me? Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear. And since you know you cannot see yourself So well as by reflection, I, your glass, Will modestly discover to yourself That of yourself which you yet know not of. And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus. Were I a common laughter, or did use To stale with ordinary oaths my love To every new protester; if you know That I do fawn on men and hug them hard And after scandal them, or if you know That I profess myself in banqueting To all the rout, then hold me dangerous. Flourish and shout. What means this shouting? I do fear the people Choose Caesar for their king. Ay, do you fear it? Then must I think you would not have it so. I would not, Cassius, yet I love him well. But wherefore do you hold me here so long? What is it that you would impart to me? If it be aught toward the general good, Set honor in one eye and death i’ th’ other And I will look on both indifferently; For let the gods so speed me as I love The name of honor more than I fear death. I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus, As well as I do know your outward favor. Well, honor is the subject of my story. I cannot tell what you and other men Think of this life; but, for my single self, I had as lief not be as live to be In awe of such a thing as I myself. I was born free as Caesar; so were you; We both have fed as well, and we can both Endure the winter’s cold as well as he. For once, upon a raw and gusty day, The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores, Caesar said to me “Dar’st thou, Cassius, now Leap in with me into this angry flood And swim to yonder point?” Upon the word, Accoutered as I was, I plungèd in And bade him follow; so indeed he did. The torrent roared, and we did buffet it With lusty sinews, throwing it aside And stemming it with hearts of controversy. But ere we could arrive the point proposed, Caesar cried “Help me, Cassius, or I sink!” as Aeneas, our great ancestor, Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber Did I the tired Caesar. And this man Is now become a god, and Cassius is A wretched creature and must bend his body If Caesar carelessly but nod on him. He had a fever when he was in Spain, And when the fit was on him, I did mark How he did shake. ’Tis true, this god did shake. His coward lips did from their color fly, And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world Did lose his luster. I did hear him groan. Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans Mark him and write his speeches in their books, “Alas,” it cried “Give me some drink, Titinius” As a sick girl. You gods, it doth amaze me A man of such a feeble temper should So get the start of the majestic world And bear the palm alone. Shout. Flourish. Another general shout! I do believe that these applauses are For some new honors that are heaped on Caesar. Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world Like a Colossus, and we petty men Walk under his huge legs and peep about To find ourselves dishonorable graves. Men at some time are masters of their fates. The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, But in ourselves, that we are underlings. “Brutus” and “Caesar”—what should be in that “Caesar”? Why should that name be sounded more than yours? Write them together, yours is as fair a name; Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well; Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with ’em, “Brutus” will start a spirit as soon as “Caesar.” Now, in the names of all the gods at once, Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed! Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods! When went there by an age, since the great flood, But it was famed with more than with one man? When could they say, till now, that talked of Rome, That her wide walks encompassed but one man? Now is it Rome indeed, and room enough When there is in it but one only man. you and I have heard our fathers say There was a Brutus once that would have brooked Th’ eternal devil to keep his state in Rome As easily as a king. That you do love me, I am nothing jealous. What you would work me to, I have some aim. How I have thought of this, and of these times, I shall recount hereafter. For this present, I would not, so with love I might entreat you, Be any further moved. What you have said I will consider; what you have to say I will with patience hear, and find a time Both meet to hear and answer such high things. Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this: Brutus had rather be a villager Than to repute himself a son of Rome Under these hard conditions as this time Is like to lay upon us. I am glad that my weak words Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus. Enter Caesar and his train. The games are done, and Caesar is returning. As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve, And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you What hath proceeded worthy note today. I will do so. But look you, Cassius, The angry spot doth glow on Caesar’s brow, And all the rest look like a chidden train. Calphurnia’s cheek is pale, and Cicero Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes As we have seen him in the Capitol, Being crossed in conference by some senators. Casca will tell us what the matter is. Antonius. Caesar. Let me have men about me that are fat, Sleek-headed men, and such as sleep a-nights. Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look. He thinks too much. Such men are dangerous. Fear him not, Caesar; he’s not dangerous. He is a noble Roman, and well given. Would he were fatter! But I fear him not. Yet if my name were liable to fear, I do not know the man I should avoid So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much, He is a great observer, and he looks Quite through the deeds of men. He loves no plays, As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music; Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort As if he mocked himself and scorned his spirit That could be moved to smile at anything. Such men as he be never at heart’s ease Whiles they behold a greater than themselves, And therefore are they very dangerous. I rather tell thee what is to be feared Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar. Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf, And tell me truly what thou think’st of him. Sennet. Caesar and his train exit but Casca remains behind. You pulled me by the cloak. Would you speak with me? Ay, Casca. Tell us what hath chanced today That Caesar looks so sad. Why, you were with him, were you not? I should not then ask Casca what had chanced. Why, there was a crown offered him; and, being offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand, thus, and then the people fell a-shouting. What was the second noise for? Why, for that too. They shouted thrice. What was the last cry for? Why, for that too. Was the crown offered him thrice? Ay, marry, was ’t, and he put it by thrice, every time gentler than other; and at every putting-by, mine honest neighbors shouted. Who offered him the crown? Why, Antony. Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca. I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it. It was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown (yet ’twas not a crown neither; ’twas one of these coronets), and, as I told you, he put it by once; but for all that, to my thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he offered it to him again; then he put it by again; but to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it. And then he offered it the third time. He put it the third time by, and still as he refused it the rabblement hooted and clapped their chopped hands and threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked Caesar, for he swooned and fell down at it. And for mine own part, I durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air. But soft, I pray you. What, did Caesar swoon? He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and was speechless. ’Tis very like; he hath the falling sickness. No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness. I know not what you mean by that, but I am sure Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and displeased them, as they use to do the players in the theater, I am no true man. What said he when he came unto himself? Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common herd was glad he refused the crown, he plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his throat to cut. An I had been a man of any occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word, I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so he fell. When he came to himself again, he said if he had done or said anything amiss, he desired their Worships to think it was his infirmity. Three or four wenches where I stood cried “Alas, good soul!” and forgave him with all their hearts. But there’s no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less. And, after that, he came thus sad away? Ay. Did Cicero say anything? Ay, he spoke Greek. To what effect? Nay, an I tell you that, I’ll ne’er look you i’ th’ face again. But those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads. But for mine own part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarves off Caesar’s images, are put to silence. Fare you well. There was more foolery yet, if I could remember it. Will you sup with me tonight, Casca? No, I am promised forth. Will you dine with me tomorrow? Ay, if I be alive, and your mind hold, and your dinner worth the eating. Good. I will expect you. Do so. Farewell both. He exits. What a blunt fellow is this grown to be! He was quick mettle when he went to school. So is he now in execution Of any bold or noble enterprise, However he puts on this tardy form. This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit, Which gives men stomach to digest his words With better appetite. And so it is. For this time I will leave you. Tomorrow, if you please to speak with me, I will come home to you; or, if you will, Come home to me, and I will wait for you. I will do so. Till then, think of the world. Brutus exits. Well, Brutus, thou art noble. Yet I see Thy honorable mettle may be wrought From that it is disposed. Therefore it is meet That noble minds keep ever with their likes; For who so firm that cannot be seduced? Caesar doth bear me hard, but he loves Brutus. If I were Brutus now, and he were Cassius, He should not humor me. I will this night In several hands in at his windows throw, As if they came from several citizens, Writings, all tending to the great opinion That Rome holds of his name, wherein obscurely Caesar’s ambition shall be glancèd at And after this, let Caesar seat him sure, For we will shake him, or worse days endure. He exits.",
      "Flourish. Enter Caesar, Antony, Lepidus; Brutus, Cassius, Casca, Decius, Metellus, Trebonius, Cinna; Publius, Popilius, Artemidorus, the Soothsayer, and other Senators and Petitioners. The ides of March are come. SOOTHSAYER Ay, Caesar, but not gone. ARTEMIDORUS Hail, Caesar. Read this schedule. Trebonius doth desire you to o’erread, At your best leisure, this his humble suit. O Caesar, read mine first, for mine’s a suit That touches Caesar nearer. Read it, great Caesar. What touches us ourself shall be last served. Delay not, Caesar; read it instantly. What, is the fellow mad? Sirrah, give place. What, urge you your petitions in the street? Come to the Capitol. Caesar goes forward, the rest following. to Cassius I wish your enterprise today may thrive. What enterprise, Popilius? Fare you well. He walks away. What said Popilius Lena? He wished today our enterprise might thrive. I fear our purpose is discoverèd. Look how he makes to Caesar. Mark him. Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention.— Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known, Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back, For I will slay myself. Cassius, be constant. Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes, For look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change. Trebonius knows his time, for look you, Brutus, He draws Mark Antony out of the way. Trebonius and Antony exit. Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him go And presently prefer his suit to Caesar. He is addressed. Press near and second him. Casca, you are the first that rears your hand. Are we all ready? What is now amiss That Caesar and his Senate must redress? kneeling Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar, Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat An humble heart. I must prevent thee, Cimber. These couchings and these lowly courtesies Might fire the blood of ordinary men And turn preordinance and first decree Into the law of children. Be not fond To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood That will be thawed from the true quality With that which melteth fools—I mean sweet words, Low-crookèd curtsies, and base spaniel fawning. Thy brother by decree is banishèd. If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him, I spurn thee like a cur out of my way. Know: Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause Will he be satisfied. Is there no voice more worthy than my own To sound more sweetly in great Caesar’s ear For the repealing of my banished brother? kneeling I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar, Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may Have an immediate freedom of repeal. What, Brutus? kneeling Pardon, Caesar; Caesar, pardon! As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber. I could be well moved, if I were as you. If I could pray to move, prayers would move me. But I am constant as the Northern Star, Of whose true fixed and resting quality There is no fellow in the firmament. The skies are painted with unnumbered sparks; They are all fire, and every one doth shine. But there’s but one in all doth hold his place. So in the world: ’tis furnished well with men, And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive. Yet in the number I do know but one That unassailable holds on his rank, Unshaked of motion; and that I am he Let me a little show it, even in this: That I was constant Cimber should be banished And constant do remain to keep him so. kneeling O Caesar— Hence. Wilt thou lift up Olympus? kneeling Great Caesar— Doth not Brutus bootless kneel? Speak, hands, for me! As Casca strikes, the others rise up and stab Caesar. Et tu, Brutè?—Then fall, Caesar. He dies. Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead! Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets. Some to the common pulpits and cry out “Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement.” People and Senators, be not affrighted. Fly not; stand still. Ambition’s debt is paid. Go to the pulpit, Brutus. And Cassius too. Where’s Publius? Here, quite confounded with this mutiny. Stand fast together, lest some friend of Caesar’s Should chance— Talk not of standing.—Publius, good cheer. There is no harm intended to your person, Nor to no Roman else. So tell them, Publius. And leave us, Publius, lest that the people, Rushing on us, should do your age some mischief. Do so, and let no man abide this deed But we the doers. All but the Conspirators exit. Enter Trebonius. Where is Antony? TREBONIUS Fled to his house amazed. Men, wives, and children stare, cry out, and run As it were doomsday. BRUTUS Fates, we will know your pleasures. That we shall die we know; ’tis but the time, And drawing days out, that men stand upon. Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life Cuts off so many years of fearing death. Grant that, and then is death a benefit. So are we Caesar’s friends, that have abridged His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop, And let us bathe our hands in Caesar’s blood Up to the elbows and besmear our swords. Then walk we forth, even to the marketplace, And, waving our red weapons o’er our heads, Let’s all cry “Peace, freedom, and liberty!” Stoop then, and wash. They smear their hands and swords with Caesar’s blood. How many ages hence Shall this our lofty scene be acted over In states unborn and accents yet unknown! How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport, That now on Pompey’s basis lies along No worthier than the dust! So oft as that shall be, So often shall the knot of us be called The men that gave their country liberty. What, shall we forth? Ay, every man away. Brutus shall lead, and we will grace his heels With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome. Enter a Servant. Soft, who comes here? A friend of Antony’s. kneeling Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel. Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down, And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say: Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest; Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving. Say, I love Brutus, and I honor him; Say, I feared Caesar, honored him, and loved him. If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony May safely come to him and be resolved How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death, Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead So well as Brutus living, but will follow The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus Thorough the hazards of this untrod state With all true faith. So says my master Antony. Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman. I never thought him worse. Tell him, so please him come unto this place, He shall be satisfied and, by my honor, Depart untouched. I’ll fetch him presently. Servant exits. I know that we shall have him well to friend. I wish we may; but yet have I a mind That fears him much, and my misgiving still Falls shrewdly to the purpose. Enter Antony. But here comes Antony.—Welcome, Mark Antony! O mighty Caesar, dost thou lie so low? Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.— I know not, gentlemen, what you intend, Who else must be let blood, who else is rank. If I myself, there is no hour so fit As Caesar’s death’s hour, nor no instrument Of half that worth as those your swords made rich With the most noble blood of all this world. I do beseech you, if you bear me hard, Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke, Fulfill your pleasure. Live a thousand years, I shall not find myself so apt to die; No place will please me so, no mean of death, As here by Caesar, and by you cut off, The choice and master spirits of this age. O Antony, beg not your death of us! Though now we must appear bloody and cruel, As by our hands and this our present act You see we do, yet see you but our hands And this the bleeding business they have done. Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful; And pity to the general wrong of Rome (As fire drives out fire, so pity pity) Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part, To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony. Our arms in strength of malice, and our hearts Of brothers’ temper, do receive you in With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence. Your voice shall be as strong as any man’s In the disposing of new dignities. Only be patient till we have appeased The multitude, beside themselves with fear; And then we will deliver you the cause Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him, Have thus proceeded. I doubt not of your wisdom. Let each man render me his bloody hand. First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you.— Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand.— Now, Decius Brutus, yours;—now yours, Metellus;— Yours, Cinna;—and, my valiant Casca, yours;— Though last, not least in love, yours, good Trebonius.— Gentlemen all—alas, what shall I say? My credit now stands on such slippery ground That one of two bad ways you must conceit me, Either a coward or a flatterer.— That I did love thee, Caesar, O, ’tis true! If then thy spirit look upon us now, Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death To see thy Antony making his peace, Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes— Most noble!—in the presence of thy corpse? Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds, Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood, It would become me better than to close In terms of friendship with thine enemies. Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bayed, brave hart, Here didst thou fall, and here thy hunters stand Signed in thy spoil and crimsoned in thy Lethe. O world, thou wast the forest to this hart, And this indeed, O world, the heart of thee. How like a deer strucken by many princes Dost thou here lie! Mark Antony— Pardon me, Caius Cassius. The enemies of Caesar shall say this; Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty. I blame you not for praising Caesar so. But what compact mean you to have with us? Will you be pricked in number of our friends, Or shall we on and not depend on you? Therefore I took your hands, but was indeed Swayed from the point by looking down on Caesar. Friends am I with you all and love you all, Upon this hope, that you shall give me reasons Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous. Or else were this a savage spectacle. Our reasons are so full of good regard That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar, You should be satisfied. That’s all I seek; And am, moreover, suitor that I may Produce his body to the marketplace, And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend, Speak in the order of his funeral. You shall, Mark Antony. Brutus, a word with you. Aside to Brutus. You know not what you do. Do not consent That Antony speak in his funeral. Know you how much the people may be moved By that which he will utter? aside to Cassius By your pardon, I will myself into the pulpit first And show the reason of our Caesar’s death. What Antony shall speak I will protest He speaks by leave and by permission, And that we are contented Caesar shall Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies. It shall advantage more than do us wrong. aside to Brutus I know not what may fall. I like it not. Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar’s body. You shall not in your funeral speech blame us But speak all good you can devise of Caesar And say you do ’t by our permission, Else shall you not have any hand at all About his funeral. And you shall speak In the same pulpit whereto I am going, After my speech is ended. Be it so. I do desire no more. Prepare the body, then, and follow us. All but Antony exit. O pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth, That I am meek and gentle with these butchers. Thou art the ruins of the noblest man That ever livèd in the tide of times. Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood! Over thy wounds now do I prophesy (Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue) A curse shall light upon the limbs of men; Domestic fury and fierce civil strife Shall cumber all the parts of Italy; Blood and destruction shall be so in use And dreadful objects so familiar That mothers shall but smile when they behold Their infants quartered with the hands of war, All pity choked with custom of fell deeds; And Caesar’s spirit, ranging for revenge, With Ate by his side come hot from hell, Shall in these confines with a monarch’s voice Cry “Havoc!” and let slip the dogs of war, That this foul deed shall smell above the earth With carrion men groaning for burial. Enter Octavius’ Servant. You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not? do, Mark Antony. Caesar did write for him to come to Rome. He did receive his letters and is coming, And bid me say to you by word of mouth— O Caesar! Thy heart is big. Get thee apart and weep. Passion, I see, is catching, for mine eyes, Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine, Began to water. Is thy master coming? He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome. Post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced. Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome, No Rome of safety for Octavius yet. Hie hence and tell him so.—Yet stay awhile; Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corpse Into the marketplace. There shall I try, In my oration, how the people take The cruel issue of these bloody men, According to the which thou shalt discourse To young Octavius of the state of things. Lend me your hand. They exit with Caesar’s body.",

      "Enter Brutus and Cassius with the Plebeians. We will be satisfied! Let us be satisfied! Then follow me and give me audience, friends.— Cassius, go you into the other street And part the numbers.— Those that will hear me speak, let ’em stay here; Those that will follow Cassius, go with him; And public reasons shall be renderèd Of Caesar’s death. I will hear Brutus speak. I will hear Cassius, and compare their reasons When severally we hear them renderèd. Cassius exits with some of the Plebeians. Brutus goes into the pulpit. The noble Brutus is ascended. Silence. Be patient till the last. Romans, countrymen, and lovers, hear me for my cause, and be silent that you may hear. Believe me for mine honor, and have respect to mine honor that you may believe. Censure me in your wisdom, and awake your senses that you may the better judge. If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of Caesar’s, to him I say that Brutus’ love to Caesar was no less than his. If then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer: not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living, and die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live all freemen? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him. As he was fortunate, I rejoice at it. As he was valiant, I honor him. But, as he was ambitious, I slew him. There is tears for his love, joy for his fortune, honor for his valor, and death for his ambition. Who is here so base that would be a bondman? If any, speak, for him have I offended. Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If any, speak, for him have I offended. Who is here so vile that will not love his country? If any, speak, for him have I offended. I pause for a reply. None, Brutus, none. Then none have I offended. I have done no more to Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question of his death is enrolled in the Capitol, his glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy, nor his offenses enforced for which he suffered death. Enter Mark Antony and others with Caesar’s body. Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony, who, though he had no hand in his death, shall receive the benefit of his dying—a place in the commonwealth—as which of you shall not? With this I depart: that, as I slew my best lover for the good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself when it shall please my country to need my death. Live, Brutus, live, live! Bring him with triumph home unto his house. Give him a statue with his ancestors. Let him be Caesar. Caesar’s better parts Shall be crowned in Brutus. We’ll bring him to his house with shouts and clamors. My countrymen— Peace, silence! Brutus speaks. Peace, ho! Good countrymen, let me depart alone, And, for my sake, stay here with Antony. Do grace to Caesar’s corpse, and grace his speech Tending to Caesar’s glories, which Mark Antony (By our permission) is allowed to make. I do entreat you, not a man depart, Save I alone, till Antony have spoke. He descends and exits. Stay, ho, and let us hear Mark Antony! Let him go up into the public chair. We’ll hear him.—Noble Antony, go up. For Brutus’ sake, I am beholding to you. He goes into the pulpit. What does he say of Brutus? He says for Brutus’ sake He finds himself beholding to us all. ’Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here. This Caesar was a tyrant. Nay, that’s certain. We are blest that Rome is rid of him. Peace, let us hear what Antony can say. You gentle Romans— Peace, ho! Let us hear him. Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears. I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him. The evil that men do lives after them; The good is oft interrèd with their bones. So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus Hath told you Caesar was ambitious. If it were so, it was a grievous fault, And grievously hath Caesar answered it. Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest (For Brutus is an honorable man; So are they all, all honorable men), Come I to speak in Caesar’s funeral. He was my friend, faithful and just to me, But Brutus says he was ambitious, And Brutus is an honorable man. He hath brought many captives home to Rome, Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill. Did this in Caesar seem ambitious? When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept; Ambition should be made of sterner stuff. Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, And Brutus is an honorable man. You all did see that on the Lupercal I thrice presented him a kingly crown, Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, And sure he is an honorable man. I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, But here I am to speak what I do know. You all did love him once, not without cause. What cause withholds you, then, to mourn for him?— O judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar, And I must pause till it come back to me. He weeps. Methinks there is much reason in his sayings. If thou consider rightly of the matter, Caesar has had great wrong. Has he, masters? I fear there will a worse come in his place. Marked you his words? He would not take the crown; Therefore ’tis certain he was not ambitious. If it be found so, some will dear abide it. Poor soul, his eyes are red as fire with weeping. There’s not a nobler man in Rome than Antony. Now mark him. He begins again to speak. But yesterday the word of Caesar might Have stood against the world. Now lies he there, And none so poor to do him reverence. O masters, if I were disposed to stir Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage, I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong, Who, you all know, are honorable men. I will not do them wrong. I rather choose To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you, Than I will wrong such honorable men. But here’s a parchment with the seal of Caesar. I found it in his closet. ’Tis his will. Let but the commons hear this testament, Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read, And they would go and kiss dead Caesar’s wounds And dip their napkins in his sacred blood— Yea, beg a hair of him for memory And, dying, mention it within their wills, Bequeathing it as a rich legacy Unto their issue. We’ll hear the will. Read it, Mark Antony. The will, the will! We will hear Caesar’s will. Have patience, gentle friends. I must not read it. It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you. You are not wood, you are not stones, but men. And, being men, hearing the will of Caesar, It will inflame you; it will make you mad. ’Tis good you know not that you are his heirs, For if you should, O, what would come of it? Read the will! We’ll hear it, Antony. You shall read us the will, Caesar’s will. Will you be patient? Will you stay awhile? I have o’ershot myself to tell you of it. I fear I wrong the honorable men Whose daggers have stabbed Caesar. I do fear it. They were traitors. Honorable men? The will! The testament! They were villains, murderers. The will! Read the will. You will compel me, then, to read the will? Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar, And let me show you him that made the will. Shall I descend? And will you give me leave? Come down. Descend. You shall have leave. Antony descends. A ring; stand round. Stand from the hearse. Stand from the body. Room for Antony, most noble Antony. Nay, press not so upon me. Stand far off. Stand back! Room! Bear back! If you have tears, prepare to shed them now. You all do know this mantle. I remember The first time ever Caesar put it on. ’Twas on a summer’s evening in his tent, That day he overcame the Nervii. Look, in this place ran Cassius’ dagger through. See what a rent the envious Casca made. Through this the well-belovèd Brutus stabbed, And, as he plucked his cursèd steel away, Mark how the blood of Caesar followed it, As rushing out of doors to be resolved If Brutus so unkindly knocked or no; For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar’s angel. Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him! This was the most unkindest cut of all. For when the noble Caesar saw him stab, Ingratitude, more strong than traitors’ arms, Quite vanquished him. Then burst his mighty heart, And, in his mantle muffling up his face, Even at the base of Pompey’s statue (Which all the while ran blood) great Caesar fell. what a fall was there, my countrymen! Then I and you and all of us fell down, Whilst bloody treason flourished over us. now you weep, and I perceive you feel The dint of pity. These are gracious drops. Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold Our Caesar’s vesture wounded? Look you here, Antony lifts Caesar’s cloak. Here is himself, marred as you see with traitors. O piteous spectacle! O noble Caesar! O woeful day! O traitors, villains! O most bloody sight! We will be revenged. Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill! Slay! Let not a traitor live! Stay, countrymen. Peace there! Hear the noble Antony. We’ll hear him, we’ll follow him, we’ll die with him. Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up To such a sudden flood of mutiny. They that have done this deed are honorable. What private griefs they have, alas, I know not, That made them do it. They are wise and honorable And will no doubt with reasons answer you. I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts. I am no orator, as Brutus is, But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man That love my friend, and that they know full well That gave me public leave to speak of him. For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth, Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech To stir men’s blood. I only speak right on. I tell you that which you yourselves do know, Show you sweet Caesar’s wounds, poor poor dumb mouths, And bid them speak for me. But were I Brutus, And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue In every wound of Caesar that should move The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny. We’ll mutiny. We’ll burn the house of Brutus. Away then. Come, seek the conspirators. Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak. Peace, ho! Hear Antony, most noble Antony! Why, friends, you go to do you know not what. Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves? Alas, you know not. I must tell you then. You have forgot the will I told you of. Most true. The will! Let’s stay and hear the will. Here is the will, and under Caesar’s seal: To every Roman citizen he gives, To every several man, seventy-five drachmas. Most noble Caesar! We’ll revenge his death. O royal Caesar! Hear me with patience. Peace, ho! Moreover, he hath left you all his walks, His private arbors, and new-planted orchards, On this side Tiber. He hath left them you, And to your heirs forever—common pleasures To walk abroad and recreate yourselves. Here was a Caesar! When comes such another? Never, never!—Come, away, away! We’ll burn his body in the holy place And with the brands fire the traitors’ houses. Take up the body. Go fetch fire. Pluck down benches. Pluck down forms, windows, anything. Plebeians exit with Caesar’s body. Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot; Take thou what course thou wilt. Enter Servant. How now, fellow? Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome. Where is he? He and Lepidus are at Caesar’s house. And thither will I straight to visit him. He comes upon a wish. Fortune is merry And in this mood will give us anything.

      "Enter Brutus and Cassius with the Plebeians. We will be satisfied! Let us be satisfied! Then follow me and give me audience, friends.— Cassius, go you into the other street And part the numbers.— Those that will hear me speak, let ’em stay here; Those that will follow Cassius, go with him; And public reasons shall be renderèd Of Caesar’s death. I will hear Brutus speak. I will hear Cassius, and compare their reasons When severally we hear them renderèd. Cassius exits with some of the Plebeians. Brutus goes into the pulpit. The noble Brutus is ascended. Silence. Be patient till the last. Romans, countrymen, and lovers, hear me for my cause, and be silent that you may hear. Believe me for mine honor, and have respect to mine honor that you may believe. Censure me in your wisdom, and awake your senses that you may the better judge. If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of Caesar’s, to him I say that Brutus’ love to Caesar was no less than his. If then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer: not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living, and die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live all freemen? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him. As he was fortunate, I rejoice at it. As he was valiant, I honor him. But, as he was ambitious, I slew him. There is tears for his love, joy for his fortune, honor for his valor, and death for his ambition. Who is here so base that would be a bondman? If any, speak, for him have I offended. Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If any, speak, for him have I offended. Who is here so vile that will not love his country? If any, speak, for him have I offended. I pause for a reply. None, Brutus, none. Then none have I offended. I have done no more to Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question of his death is enrolled in the Capitol, his glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy, nor his offenses enforced for which he suffered death. Enter Mark Antony and others with Caesar’s body. Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony, who, though he had no hand in his death, shall receive the benefit of his dying—a place in the commonwealth—as which of you shall not? With this I depart: that, as I slew my best lover for the good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself when it shall please my country to need my death. Live, Brutus, live, live! Bring him with triumph home unto his house. Give him a statue with his ancestors. Let him be Caesar. Caesar’s better parts Shall be crowned in Brutus. We’ll bring him to his house with shouts and clamors. My countrymen— Peace, silence! Brutus speaks. Peace, ho! Good countrymen, let me depart alone, And, for my sake, stay here with Antony. Do grace to Caesar’s corpse, and grace his speech Tending to Caesar’s glories, which Mark Antony (By our permission) is allowed to make. I do entreat you, not a man depart, Save I alone, till Antony have spoke. He descends and exits. Stay, ho, and let us hear Mark Antony! Let him go up into the public chair. We’ll hear him.—Noble Antony, go up. For Brutus’ sake, I am beholding to you. He goes into the pulpit. What does he say of Brutus? He says for Brutus’ sake He finds himself beholding to us all. ’Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here. This Caesar was a tyrant. Nay, that’s certain. We are blest that Rome is rid of him. Peace, let us hear what Antony can say. You gentle Romans— Peace, ho! Let us hear him. Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears. I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him. The evil that men do lives after them; The good is oft interrèd with their bones. So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus Hath told you Caesar was ambitious. If it were so, it was a grievous fault, And grievously hath Caesar answered it. Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest (For Brutus is an honorable man; So are they all, all honorable men), Come I to speak in Caesar’s funeral. He was my friend, faithful and just to me, But Brutus says he was ambitious, And Brutus is an honorable man. He hath brought many captives home to Rome, Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill. Did this in Caesar seem ambitious? When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept; Ambition should be made of sterner stuff. Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, And Brutus is an honorable man. You all did see that on the Lupercal I thrice presented him a kingly crown, Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, And sure he is an honorable man.

Is there no voice more worthy than my own To sound more sweetly in great Caesar’s ear For the repealing of my banished brother? kneeling I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar, Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may Have an immediate freedom of repeal. What, Brutus? kneeling Pardon, Caesar; Caesar, pardon! As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber. I could be well moved, if I were as you. If I could pray to move, prayers would move me. But I am constant as the Northern Star, Of whose true fixed and resting quality There is no fellow in the firmament. The skies are painted with unnumbered sparks; They are all fire, and every one doth shine. But there’s but one in all doth hold his place. So in the world: ’tis furnished well with men, And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive. Yet in the number I do know but one That unassailable holds on his rank, Unshaked of motion; and that I am he Let me a little show it, even in this: That I was constant Cimber should be banished And constant do remain to keep him so. kneeling O Caesar— Hence. Wilt thou lift up Olympus? kneeling Great Caesar— Doth not Brutus bootless kneel? Speak, hands, for me! As Casca strikes, the others rise up and stab Caesar. Et tu, Brutè?—Then fall, Caesar. He dies. Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead! Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets. Some to the common pulpits and cry out “Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement.” People and Senators, be not affrighted. Fly not; stand still. Ambition’s debt is paid. Go to the pulpit, Brutus. And Cassius too. Where’s Publius? Here, quite confounded with this mutiny. Stand fast together, lest some friend of Caesar’s Should chance— Talk not of standing.—Publius, good cheer. There is no harm intended to your person, Nor to no Roman else. So tell them, Publius. And leave us, Publius, lest that the people, Rushing on us, should do your age some mischief. Do so, and let no man abide this deed But we the doers. All but the Conspirators exit. Enter Trebonius. Where is Antony? TREBONIUS Fled to his house amazed. Men, wives, and children stare, cry out, and run As it were doomsday. BRUTUS Fates, we will know your pleasures. That we shall die we know; ’tis but the time, And drawing days out, that men stand upon. Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life Cuts off so many years of fearing death. Grant that, and then is death a benefit. So are we Caesar’s friends, that have abridged His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop, And let us bathe our hands in Caesar’s blood Up to the elbows and besmear our swords. Then walk we forth, even to the marketplace, And, waving our red weapons o’er our heads, Let’s all cry “Peace, freedom, and liberty!” Stoop then, and wash. They smear their hands and swords with Caesar’s blood. How many ages hence Shall this our lofty scene be acted over In states unborn and accents yet unknown! How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport, That now on Pompey’s basis lies along No worthier than the dust! So oft as that shall be, So often shall the knot of us be called The men that gave their country liberty. What, shall we forth? Ay, every man away. Brutus shall lead, and we will grace his heels With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome. Enter a Servant. Soft, who comes here? A friend of Antony’s. kneeling Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel. Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down, And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say: Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest; Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving. Say, I love Brutus, and I honor him; Say, I feared Caesar, honored him, and loved him. If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony May safely come to him and be resolved How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death, Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead So well as Brutus living, but will follow The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus Thorough the hazards of this untrod state With all true faith. So says my master Antony. Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman. I never thought him worse. Tell him, so please him come unto this place, He shall be satisfied and, by my honor, Depart untouched. I’ll fetch him presently. Servant exits. I know that we shall have him well to friend. I wish we may; but yet have I a mind That fears him much, and my misgiving still Falls shrewdly to the purpose. Enter Antony. But here comes Antony.—Welcome, Mark Antony! O mighty Caesar, dost thou lie so low? Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.— I know not, gentlemen, what you intend, Who else must be let blood, who else is rank. If I myself, there is no hour so fit As Caesar’s death’s hour, nor no instrument Of half that worth as those your swords made rich With the most noble blood of all this world. I do beseech you, if you bear me hard, Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke, Fulfill your pleasure. Live a thousand years, I shall not find myself so apt to die; No place will please me so, no mean of death, As here by Caesar, and by you cut off, The choice and master spirits of this age. O Antony, beg not your death of us! Though now we must appear bloody and cruel, As by our hands and this our present act You see we do, yet see you but our hands And this the bleeding business they have done. Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful; And pity to the general wrong of Rome (As fire drives out fire, so pity pity) Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part, To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony. Our arms in strength of malice, and our hearts Of brothers’ temper, do receive you in With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence. Your voice shall be as strong as any man’s In the disposing of new dignities. Only be patient till we have appeased The multitude, beside themselves with fear; And then we will deliver you the cause Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him, Have thus proceeded. I doubt not of your wisdom. Let each man render me his bloody hand. First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you.— Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand.— Now, Decius Brutus, yours;—now yours, Metellus;— Yours, Cinna;—and, my valiant Casca, yours;— Though last, not least in love, yours, good Trebonius.— Gentlemen all—alas, what shall I say? My credit now stands on such slippery ground That one of two bad ways you must conceit me, Either a coward or a flatterer.— That I did love thee, Caesar, O, ’tis true! If then thy spirit look upon us now, Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death To see thy Antony making his peace, Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes— Most noble!—in the presence of thy corpse? Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds, Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood, It would become me better than to close In terms of friendship with thine enemies. Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bayed, brave hart, Here didst thou fall, and here thy hunters stand Signed in thy spoil and crimsoned in thy Lethe. O world, thou wast the forest to this hart, And this indeed, O world, the heart of thee. How like a deer strucken by many princes Dost thou here lie! Mark Antony— Pardon me, Caius Cassius. The enemies of Caesar shall say this; Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty. I blame you not for praising Caesar so. But what compact mean you to have with us? Will you be pricked in number of our friends, Or shall we on and not depend on you? Therefore I took your hands, but was indeed Swayed from the point by looking down on Caesar. Friends am I with you all and love you all, Upon this hope, that you shall give me reasons Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous. Or else were this a savage spectacle. Our reasons are so full of good regard That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar, You should be satisfied. That’s all I seek; And am, moreover, suitor that I may Produce his body to the marketplace, And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend, Speak in the order of his funeral. You shall, Mark Antony. Brutus, a word with you. Aside to Brutus. You know not what you do. Do not consent That Antony speak in his funeral. Know you how much the people may be moved By that which he will utter? aside to Cassius By your pardon, I will myself into the pulpit first And show the reason of our Caesar’s death. What Antony shall speak I will protest He speaks by leave and by permission, And that we are contented Caesar shall Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies. It shall advantage more than do us wrong. aside to Brutus I know not what may fall. I like it not. Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar’s body. You shall not in your funeral speech blame us But speak all good you can devise of Caesar And say you do ’t by our permission, Else shall you not have any hand at all About his funeral. And you shall speak In the same pulpit whereto I am going, After my speech is ended. Be it so. I do desire no more. Prepare the body, then, and follow us. All but Antony exit. O pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth, That I am meek and gentle with these butchers. Thou art the ruins of the noblest man That ever livèd in the tide of times. Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood! Over thy wounds now do I prophesy (Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue) A curse shall light upon the limbs of men; Domestic fury and fierce civil strife Shall cumber all the parts of Italy; Blood and destruction shall be so in use And dreadful objects so familiar That mothers shall but smile when they behold Their infants quartered with the hands of war, All pity choked with custom of fell deeds; And Caesar’s spirit, ranging for revenge, With Ate by his side come hot from hell, Shall in these confines with a monarch’s voice Cry “Havoc!” and let slip the dogs of war, That this foul deed shall smell above the earth With carrion men groaning for burial. Enter Octavius’ Servant. You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not? do, Mark Antony. Caesar did write for him to come to Rome. He did receive his letters and is coming, And bid me say to you by word of mouth— O Caesar! Thy heart is big. Get thee apart and weep. Passion, I see, is catching, for mine eyes, Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine, Began to water. Is thy master coming? He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome. Post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced. Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome, No Rome of safety for Octavius yet. Hie hence and tell him so.—Yet stay awhile; Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corpse Into the marketplace. There shall I try, In my oration, how the people take The cruel issue of these bloody men, According to the which thou shalt discourse To young Octavius of the state of things. Lend me your hand. They exit with Caesar’s body.",
      "Enter Caesar, Antony for the course, Calphurnia, Portia, Decius, Cicero, Brutus, Cassius, Casca, a Soothsayer; after them Marullus and Flavius and Commoners. Calphurnia. Peace, ho! Caesar speaks. Calphurnia. Here, my lord. Stand you directly in Antonius’ way When he doth run his course.—Antonius. Caesar, my lord. Forget not in your speed, Antonius, To touch Calphurnia, for our elders say The barren, touchèd in this holy chase, Shake off their sterile curse. I shall remember. When Caesar says “Do this,” it is performed. Set on and leave no ceremony out. Sennet. Caesar. Ha! Who calls? Bid every noise be still. Peace, yet again! Who is it in the press that calls on me? I hear a tongue shriller than all the music Cry “Caesar.” Speak. Caesar is turned to hear. Beware the ides of March. What man is that? A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March. Set him before me. Let me see his face. Fellow, come from the throng. The Soothsayer comes forward. Look upon Caesar. What sayst thou to me now? Speak once again. Beware the ides of March. He is a dreamer. Let us leave him. Pass. Sennet. All but Brutus and Cassius exit. Will you go see the order of the course? Not I. I pray you, do. I am not gamesome. I do lack some part Of that quick spirit that is in Antony. Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires. I’ll leave you. Brutus, I do observe you now of late. I have not from your eyes that gentleness And show of love as I was wont to have. You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand Over your friend that loves you. Cassius, Be not deceived. If I have veiled my look, I turn the trouble of my countenance Merely upon myself. Vexèd I am Of late with passions of some difference, Conceptions only proper to myself, Which give some soil, perhaps, to my behaviors. But let not therefore my good friends be grieved (Among which number, Cassius, be you one) Nor construe any further my neglect Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war, Forgets the shows of love to other men. Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion, By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations. Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face? No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself But by reflection, by some other things. ’Tis just. And it is very much lamented, Brutus, That you have no such mirrors as will turn Your hidden worthiness into your eye, That you might see your shadow. I have heard Where many of the best respect in Rome, Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus And groaning underneath this age’s yoke, Have wished that noble Brutus had his eyes. Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius, That you would have me seek into myself For that which is not in me? Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear. And since you know you cannot see yourself So well as by reflection, I, your glass, Will modestly discover to yourself That of yourself which you yet know not of. And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus. Were I a common laughter, or did use To stale with ordinary oaths my love To every new protester; if you know That I do fawn on men and hug them hard And after scandal them, or if you know That I profess myself in banqueting To all the rout, then hold me dangerous. Flourish and shout. What means this shouting? I do fear the people Choose Caesar for their king. Ay, do you fear it? Then must I think you would not have it so. I would not, Cassius, yet I love him well. But wherefore do you hold me here so long? What is it that you would impart to me? If it be aught toward the general good, Set honor in one eye and death i’ th’ other And I will look on both indifferently; For let the gods so speed me as I love The name of honor more than I fear death. I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus, As well as I do know your outward favor. Well, honor is the subject of my story. I cannot tell what you and other men Think of this life; but, for my single self, I had as lief not be as live to be In awe of such a thing as I myself. I was born free as Caesar; so were you; We both have fed as well, and we can both Endure the winter’s cold as well as he. For once, upon a raw and gusty day, The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores, Caesar said to me “Dar’st thou, Cassius, now Leap in with me into this angry flood And swim to yonder point?” Upon the word, Accoutered as I was, I plungèd in And bade him follow; so indeed he did. The torrent roared, and we did buffet it With lusty sinews, throwing it aside And stemming it with hearts of controversy. But ere we could arrive the point proposed, Caesar cried “Help me, Cassius, or I sink!” as Aeneas, our great ancestor, Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber Did I the tired Caesar. And this man Is now become a god, and Cassius is A wretched creature and must bend his body If Caesar carelessly but nod on him. He had a fever when he was in Spain, And when the fit was on him, I did mark How he did shake. ’Tis true, this god did shake. His coward lips did from their color fly, And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world Did lose his luster. I did hear him groan. Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans Mark him and write his speeches in their books, “Alas,” it cried “Give me some drink, Titinius” As a sick girl. You gods, it doth amaze me A man of such a feeble temper should So get the start of the majestic world And bear the palm alone. Shout. Flourish. Another general shout! I do believe that these applauses are For some new honors that are heaped on Caesar. Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world Like a Colossus, and we petty men Walk under his huge legs and peep about To find ourselves dishonorable graves. Men at some time are masters of their fates. The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, But in ourselves, that we are underlings. “Brutus” and “Caesar”—what should be in that “Caesar”? Why should that name be sounded more than yours? Write them together, yours is as fair a name; Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well; Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with ’em, “Brutus” will start a spirit as soon as “Caesar.” Now, in the names of all the gods at once, Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed! Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods! When went there by an age, since the great flood, But it was famed with more than with one man? When could they say, till now, that talked of Rome, That her wide walks encompassed but one man? Now is it Rome indeed, and room enough When there is in it but one only man. you and I have heard our fathers say There was a Brutus once that would have brooked Th’ eternal devil to keep his state in Rome As easily as a king. That you do love me, I am nothing jealous. What you would work me to, I have some aim. How I have thought of this, and of these times, I shall recount hereafter. For this present, I would not, so with love I might entreat you, Be any further moved. What you have said I will consider; what you have to say I will with patience hear, and find a time Both meet to hear and answer such high things. Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this: Brutus had rather be a villager Than to repute himself a son of Rome Under these hard conditions as this time Is like to lay upon us. I am glad that my weak words Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus. Enter Caesar and his train. The games are done, and Caesar is returning. As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve, And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you What hath proceeded worthy note today. I will do so. But look you, Cassius, The angry spot doth glow on Caesar’s brow, And all the rest look like a chidden train. Calphurnia’s cheek is pale, and Cicero Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes As we have seen him in the Capitol, Being crossed in conference by some senators. Casca will tell us what the matter is. Antonius. Caesar. Let me have men about me that are fat, Sleek-headed men, and such as sleep a-nights. Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look. He thinks too much. Such men are dangerous. Fear him not, Caesar; he’s not dangerous. He is a noble Roman, and well given. Would he were fatter! But I fear him not. Yet if my name were liable to fear, I do not know the man I should avoid So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much, He is a great observer, and he looks Quite through the deeds of men. He loves no plays, As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music; Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort As if he mocked himself and scorned his spirit That could be moved to smile at anything. Such men as he be never at heart’s ease Whiles they behold a greater than themselves, And therefore are they very dangerous. I rather tell thee what is to be feared Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar. Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf, And tell me truly what thou think’st of him. Sennet. Caesar and his train exit but Casca remains behind. You pulled me by the cloak. Would you speak with me? Ay, Casca. Tell us what hath chanced today That Caesar looks so sad. Why, you were with him, were you not? I should not then ask Casca what had chanced. Why, there was a crown offered him; and, being offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand, thus, and then the people fell a-shouting. What was the second noise for? Why, for that too. They shouted thrice. What was the last cry for? Why, for that too. Was the crown offered him thrice? Ay, marry, was ’t, and he put it by thrice, every time gentler than other; and at every putting-by, mine honest neighbors shouted. Who offered him the crown? Why, Antony. Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca. I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it. It was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown (yet ’twas not a crown neither; ’twas one of these coronets), and, as I told you, he put it by once; but for all that, to my thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he offered it to him again; then he put it by again; but to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it. And then he offered it the third time. He put it the third time by, and still as he refused it the rabblement hooted and clapped their chopped hands and threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked Caesar, for he swooned and fell down at it. And for mine own part, I durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air. But soft, I pray you. What, did Caesar swoon? He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and was speechless. ’Tis very like; he hath the falling sickness. No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness. I know not what you mean by that, but I am sure Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and displeased them, as they use to do the players in the theater, I am no true man. What said he when he came unto himself? Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common herd was glad he refused the crown, he plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his throat to cut. An I had been a man of any occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word, I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so he fell. When he came to himself again, he said if he had done or said anything amiss, he desired their Worships to think it was his infirmity. Three or four wenches where I stood cried “Alas, good soul!” and forgave him with all their hearts. But there’s no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less. And, after that, he came thus sad away? Ay. Did Cicero say anything? Ay, he spoke Greek. To what effect? Nay, an I tell you that, I’ll ne’er look you i’ th’ face again. But those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads. But for mine own part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarves off Caesar’s images, are put to silence. Fare you well. There was more foolery yet, if I could remember it. Will you sup with me tonight, Casca? No, I am promised forth. Will you dine with me tomorrow? Ay, if I be alive, and your mind hold, and your dinner worth the eating. Good. I will expect you. Do so. Farewell both. He exits. What a blunt fellow is this grown to be! He was quick mettle when he went to school. So is he now in execution Of any bold or noble enterprise, However he puts on this tardy form. This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit, Which gives men stomach to digest his words With better appetite. And so it is. For this time I will leave you. Tomorrow, if you please to speak with me, I will come home to you; or, if you will, Come home to me, and I will wait for you. I will do so. Till then, think of the world. Brutus exits. Well, Brutus, thou art noble. Yet I see Thy honorable mettle may be wrought From that it is disposed. Therefore it is meet That noble minds keep ever with their likes; For who so firm that cannot be seduced? Caesar doth bear me hard, but he loves Brutus. If I were Brutus now, and he were Cassius, He should not humor me. I will this night In several hands in at his windows throw, As if they came from several citizens, Writings, all tending to the great opinion That Rome holds of his name, wherein obscurely Caesar’s ambition shall be glancèd at And after this, let Caesar seat him sure, For we will shake him, or worse days endure. He exits.",
      "The scene reveals Cassius's manipulative nature as he exploits Brutus's internal conflict and concern for the \"general good\" to plant seeds of doubt about Caesar's ambition. Brutus, though initially resistant, is swayed by Cassius's flattery and appeals to his sense of honor, suggesting a vulnerability to persuasion that Cassius intends to exploit. Caesar's distrust of Cassius, voiced to Antony, highlights the political tension and foreshadows the conspiracy against him. Cassius's soliloquy at the end confirms his plan to manipulate Brutus further, indicating a calculated strategy to undermine Caesar's power.",
      "The scene reveals the ruthless pragmatism of Antony and Octavius as they consolidate power, demonstrated by their cold-blooded execution of enemies and willingness to sacrifice even family. Antony's dismissive attitude towards Lepidus, viewing him as a mere tool, highlights the power dynamics within the triumvirate and foreshadows future conflict. The political tension escalates as they acknowledge the growing threat posed by Brutus and Cassius, prompting them to strategize and solidify their alliance. This scene establishes a cause-effect relationship: the assassination of Caesar leads to a brutal power struggle and the formation of opposing factions preparing for war.",
      "Enter Mark Antony and others with Caesar’s body. Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony, who, though he had no hand in his death, shall receive the benefit of his dying—a place in the commonwealth—as which of you shall not? With this I depart: that, as I slew my best lover for the good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself when it shall please my country to need my death. Live, Brutus, live, live! Bring him with triumph home unto his house. Give him a statue with his ancestors. Let him be Caesar.",
      "Room for Antony, most noble Antony. Nay, press not so upon me. Stand far off. Stand back! Room! Bear back! If you have tears, prepare to shed them now. You all do know this mantle. I remember The first time ever Caesar put it on. ’Twas on a summer’s evening in his tent, That day he overcame the Nervii. Look, in this place ran Cassius’ dagger through. See what a rent the envious Casca made. Through this the well-belovèd Brutus stabbed, And, as he plucked his cursèd steel away, Mark how the blood of Caesar followed it, As rushing out of doors to be resolved If Brutus so unkindly knocked or no; For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar’s angel. Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him! This was the most unkindest cut of all. For when the noble Caesar saw him stab, Ingratitude, more strong than traitors’ arms, Quite vanquished him. Then burst his mighty heart, And, in his mantle muffling up his face, Even at the base of Pompey’s statue (Which all the while ran blood) great Caesar fell. what a fall was there, my countrymen! Then I and you and all of us fell down, Whilst bloody treason flourished over us.",

      "Thunder and lightning. Enter Nor heaven nor Earth have been at peace tonight. Thrice hath Calphurnia in her sleep cried out “Help ho, they murder Caesar!”—Who’s within? Enter a Servant. My lord. Go bid the priests do present sacrifice, And bring me their opinions of success. I will, my lord. He exits. Enter Calphurnia. What mean you, Caesar? Think you to walk forth? You shall not stir out of your house today. Caesar shall forth. The things that threatened me Ne’er looked but on my back. When they shall see The face of Caesar, they are vanishèd. Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies, Yet now they fright me. There is one within, Besides the things that we have heard and seen, Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch. A lioness hath whelpèd in the streets, And graves have yawned and yielded up their dead. Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds In ranks and squadrons and right form of war, Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol. The noise of battle hurtled in the air, Horses did neigh, and dying men did groan, And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets. O Caesar, these things are beyond all use, And I do fear them. What can be avoided Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods? Yet Caesar shall go forth, for these predictions Are to the world in general as to Caesar. When beggars die there are no comets seen; The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes. Cowards die many times before their deaths; The valiant never taste of death but once. Of all the wonders that I yet have heard, It seems to me most strange that men should fear, Seeing that death, a necessary end, Will come when it will come. Enter a Servant. What say the augurers? They would not have you to stir forth today. Plucking the entrails of an offering forth, They could not find a heart within the beast. The gods do this in shame of cowardice. Caesar should be a beast without a heart If he should stay at home today for fear. No, Caesar shall not. Danger knows full well That Caesar is more dangerous than he. We are two lions littered in one day, And I the elder and more terrible. And Caesar shall go forth. Alas, my lord, Your wisdom is consumed in confidence. Do not go forth today. Call it my fear That keeps you in the house, and not your own. We’ll send Mark Antony to the Senate House, And he shall say you are not well today. Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this. She kneels. Mark Antony shall say I am not well, And for thy humor I will stay at home. He lifts her up. Enter Decius. Here’s Decius Brutus; he shall tell them so. Caesar, all hail! Good morrow, worthy Caesar. I come to fetch you to the Senate House. And you are come in very happy time To bear my greeting to the Senators And tell them that I will not come today. Cannot is false, and that I dare not, falser. I will not come today. Tell them so, Decius. Say he is sick. Shall Caesar send a lie? Have I in conquest stretched mine arm so far, To be afeard to tell graybeards the truth? Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come. Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause, Lest I be laughed at when I tell them so. The cause is in my will. I will not come. That is enough to satisfy the Senate. But for your private satisfaction, Because I love you, I will let you know. Calphurnia here, my wife, stays me at home. She dreamt tonight she saw my statue, Which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts, Did run pure blood; and many lusty Romans Came smiling and did bathe their hands in it. And these does she apply for warnings and portents And evils imminent, and on her knee Hath begged that I will stay at home today. This dream is all amiss interpreted. It was a vision fair and fortunate. Your statue spouting blood in many pipes, In which so many smiling Romans bathed, Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck Reviving blood, and that great men shall press For tinctures, stains, relics, and cognizance. This by Calphurnia’s dream is signified. And this way have you well expounded it. I have, when you have heard what I can say. And know it now: the Senate have concluded To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar. If you shall send them word you will not come, Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock Apt to be rendered, for someone to say “Break up the Senate till another time, When Caesar’s wife shall meet with better dreams.” If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper “Lo, Caesar is afraid”? Pardon me, Caesar, for my dear dear love To your proceeding bids me tell you this, And reason to my love is liable. How foolish do your fears seem now, Calphurnia! I am ashamèd I did yield to them. Give me my robe, for I will go. Enter Brutus, Ligarius, Metellus, Casca, Trebonius, Cinna, and Publius. And look where Publius is come to fetch me. Good morrow, Caesar. Welcome, Publius.— What, Brutus, are you stirred so early too?— Good morrow, Casca.—Caius Ligarius, Caesar was ne’er so much your enemy As that same ague which hath made you lean.— What is ’t o’clock? Caesar, ’tis strucken eight. I thank you for your pains and courtesy. Enter Antony. See, Antony that revels long a-nights Is notwithstanding up.—Good morrow, Antony. So to most noble Caesar. CAESAR, to Servant Bid them prepare within.— I am to blame to be thus waited for. Servant exits. Now, Cinna.—Now, Metellus.—What, Trebonius, I have an hour’s talk in store for you. Remember that you call on me today; Be near me that I may remember you. Caesar, I will. Aside. And so near will I be That your best friends shall wish I had been further. Good friends, go in and taste some wine with me, And we, like friends, will straightway go together. aside That every like is not the same, O Caesar, The heart of Brutus earns to think upon. They exit.",
      "Thunder and lightning. Enter Casca and Cicero. Good even, Casca. Brought you Caesar home? Why are you breathless? And why stare you so? Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero, I have seen tempests when the scolding winds Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen Th’ ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam To be exalted with the threat’ning clouds; But never till tonight, never till now, Did I go through a tempest dropping fire. Either there is a civil strife in heaven, Or else the world, too saucy with the gods, Incenses them to send destruction. Why, saw you anything more wonderful? A common slave (you know him well by sight) Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn Like twenty torches joined; and yet his hand, Not sensible of fire, remained unscorched. Besides (I ha’ not since put up my sword), Against the Capitol I met a lion, Who glazed upon me and went surly by Without annoying me. And there were drawn Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women, Transformèd with their fear, who swore they saw Men all in fire walk up and down the streets. And yesterday the bird of night did sit Even at noonday upon the marketplace, Hooting and shrieking. When these prodigies Do so conjointly meet, let not men say “These are their reasons, they are natural,” For I believe they are portentous things Unto the climate that they point upon. Indeed, it is a strange-disposèd time. But men may construe things after their fashion, Clean from the purpose of the things themselves. Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow? He doth, for he did bid Antonius Send word to you he would be there tomorrow. Good night then, Casca. This disturbèd sky Is not to walk in. Farewell, Cicero Cicero exits. Enter Cassius. Who’s there? A Roman. Casca, by your voice. Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this! A very pleasing night to honest men. Who ever knew the heavens menace so? Those that have known the Earth so full of faults. For my part, I have walked about the streets, Submitting me unto the perilous night, And thus unbracèd, Casca, as you see, Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone; And when the cross blue lightning seemed to open The breast of heaven, I did present myself Even in the aim and very flash of it. But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens? It is the part of men to fear and tremble When the most mighty gods by tokens send Such dreadful heralds to astonish us. You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life That should be in a Roman you do want, Or else you use not. You look pale, and gaze, And put on fear, and cast yourself in wonder, To see the strange impatience of the heavens. But if you would consider the true cause Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts, Why birds and beasts from quality and kind, Why old men, fools, and children calculate, Why all these things change from their ordinance, Their natures, and preformèd faculties, To monstrous quality—why, you shall find That heaven hath infused them with these spirits To make them instruments of fear and warning Unto some monstrous state. Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man Most like this dreadful night, That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars As doth the lion in the Capitol; A man no mightier than thyself or me In personal action, yet prodigious grown, And fearful, as these strange eruptions are. ’Tis Caesar that you mean, is it not, Cassius? Let it be who it is. For Romans now Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors. But, woe the while, our fathers’ minds are dead, And we are governed with our mothers’ spirits. Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish. Indeed, they say the Senators tomorrow Mean to establish Caesar as a king, And he shall wear his crown by sea and land In every place save here in Italy. I know where I will wear this dagger then; Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius. Therein, you gods, you make the weak most strong; Therein, you gods, you tyrants do defeat. Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass, Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron, Can be retentive to the strength of spirit; But life, being weary of these worldly bars, Never lacks power to dismiss itself. If I know this, know all the world besides, That part of tyranny that I do bear I can shake off at pleasure. Thunder still. So can I. So every bondman in his own hand bears The power to cancel his captivity. And why should Caesar be a tyrant, then? Poor man, I know he would not be a wolf But that he sees the Romans are but sheep; He were no lion, were not Romans hinds. Those that with haste will make a mighty fire Begin it with weak straws. What trash is Rome, What rubbish, and what offal when it serves For the base matter to illuminate So vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief, Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this Before a willing bondman; then, I know My answer must be made. But I am armed, And dangers are to me indifferent. You speak to Casca, and to such a man That is no fleering telltale. Hold. My hand. They shake hands. Be factious for redress of all these griefs, And I will set this foot of mine as far As who goes farthest. There’s a bargain made. Now know you, Casca, I have moved already Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans To undergo with me an enterprise Of honorable-dangerous consequence. And I do know by this they stay for me In Pompey’s Porch. For now, this fearful night, There is no stir or walking in the streets; And the complexion of the element In favor ’s like the work we have in hand, Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible. Enter Cinna. Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste. ’Tis Cinna; I do know him by his gait. He is a friend.—Cinna, where haste you so? To find out you. Who’s that? Metellus Cimber? No, it is Casca, one incorporate To our attempts. Am I not stayed for, Cinna? I am glad on ’t. What a fearful night is this! There’s two or three of us have seen strange sights. Am I not stayed for? Tell me. Yes, you are. O Cassius, if you could But win the noble Brutus to our party— handing him papers Be you content. Good Cinna, take this paper, And look you lay it in the Praetor’s chair, Where Brutus may but find it; and throw this In at his window; set this up with wax Upon old Brutus’ statue. All this done, Repair to Pompey’s Porch, where you shall find us. Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there? All but Metellus Cimber, and he’s gone To seek you at your house. Well, I will hie And so bestow these papers as you bade me. That done, repair to Pompey’s Theater. Cinna exits. Come, Casca, you and I will yet ere day See Brutus at his house. Three parts of him Is ours already, and the man entire Upon the next encounter yields him ours. he sits high in all the people’s hearts, And that which would appear offense in us His countenance, like richest alchemy, Will change to virtue and to worthiness. Him and his worth and our great need of him You have right well conceited. Let us go, For it is after midnight, and ere day We will awake him and be sure of him. They exit.",
      "The ominous atmosphere of the storm mirrors the political turmoil brewing in Rome, fueling Cassius's manipulative efforts. Cassius exploits Casca's fear and superstition, transforming the natural phenomena into omens of Caesar's tyranny. He strategically uses the storm to justify his conspiracy, arguing that extraordinary events demand extraordinary action. Cassius's motivation stems from a desire to dismantle Caesar's growing power, while Casca's fear makes him susceptible to Cassius's influence, setting the stage for the conspiracy to gain momentum.",
      "The plebeians' questioning of Cinna reveals their volatile emotional state and susceptibility to manipulation, fueled by the recent assassination. Cinna's honest answers are twisted, demonstrating the mob's irrationality and eagerness to find a scapegoat for their grief and confusion. This scene highlights the theme of mob rule and the dangers of unchecked public sentiment, as a simple case of mistaken identity leads to brutal violence. The plebeians' shift from questioning to vengeful destruction foreshadows further chaos and underscores the conspirators' failure to anticipate the public's reaction. The scene's conclusion, with the mob turning their rage towards the conspirators' homes, illustrates the immediate and devastating consequences of political violence on the social order.",

Cassius's initial fear of discovery gives way to a premature sense of triumph, while Brutus attempts to justify the act as a necessary sacrifice for the greater good. Antony, feigning allegiance to the conspirators, strategically manipulates them to gain an opportunity to sway public opinion, foreshadowing future conflict.

Brutus, though initially resistant, is swayed by Cassius's flattery and appeals to his sense of honor, suggesting a vulnerability to persuasion that Cassius intends to exploit. Caesar's distrust of Cassius, voiced to Antony, highlights the political tension and foreshadows the conspiracy against him. Cassius's soliloquy at the end confirms his plan to manipulate Brutus further, indicating a calculated strategy to undermine Caesar's power.",

Here comes the General.— Brutus is ta’en, Brutus is ta’en, my lord. Where is he? Safe, Antony, Brutus is safe enough. I dare assure thee that no enemy Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus. The gods defend him from so great a shame! When you do find him, or alive or dead, He will be found like Brutus, like himself. This is not Brutus, friend, but I assure you, A prize no less in worth.

      "Enter Brutus and Cassius with the Plebeians. We will be satisfied! Let us be satisfied! Then follow me and give me audience, friends.— Cassius, go you into the other street And part the numbers.— Those that will hear me speak, let ’em stay here; Those that will follow Cassius, go with him; And public reasons shall be renderèd Of Caesar’s death. I will hear Brutus speak. I will hear Cassius, and compare their reasons When severally we hear them renderèd. Cassius exits with some of the Plebeians. Brutus goes into the pulpit. The noble Brutus is ascended. Silence. Be patient till the last. Romans, countrymen, and lovers, hear me for my cause, and be silent that you may hear. Believe me for mine honor, and have respect to mine honor that you may believe. Censure me in your wisdom, and awake your senses that you may the better judge. If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of Caesar’s, to him I say that Brutus’ love to Caesar was no less than his. If then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer: not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living, and die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live all freemen? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him. As he was fortunate, I rejoice at it. As he was valiant, I honor him. But, as he was ambitious, I slew him. There is tears for his love, joy for his fortune, honor for his valor, and death for his ambition. Who is here so base that would be a bondman? If any, speak, for him have I offended. Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If any, speak, for him have I offended. Who is here so vile that will not love his country? If any, speak, for him have I offended. I pause for a reply. None, Brutus, none. Then none have I offended. I have done no more to Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question of his death is enrolled in the Capitol, his glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy, nor his offenses enforced for which he suffered death. Enter Mark Antony and others with Caesar’s body. Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony, who, though he had no hand in his death, shall receive the benefit of his dying—a place in the commonwealth—as which of you shall not? With this I depart: that, as I slew my best lover for the good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself when it shall please my country to need my death. Live, Brutus, live, live! Bring him with triumph home unto his house. Give him a statue with his ancestors. Let him be Caesar. Caesar’s better parts Shall be crowned in Brutus. We’ll bring him to his house with shouts and clamors. My countrymen— Peace, silence! Brutus speaks. Peace, ho! Good countrymen, let me depart alone, And, for my sake, stay here with Antony. Do grace to Caesar’s corpse, and grace his speech Tending to Caesar’s glories, which Mark Antony (By our permission) is allowed to make. I do entreat you, not a man depart, Save I alone, till Antony have spoke. He descends and exits. Stay, ho, and let us hear Mark Antony! Let him go up into the public chair. We’ll hear him.—Noble Antony, go up. For Brutus’ sake, I am beholding to you. He goes into the pulpit. What does he say of Brutus? He says for Brutus’ sake He finds himself beholding to us all. ’Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here. This Caesar was a tyrant. Nay, that’s certain. We are blest that Rome is rid of him. Peace, let us hear what Antony can say. You gentle Romans— Peace, ho! Let us hear him. Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears. I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him. The evil that men do lives after them; The good is oft interrèd with their bones. So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus Hath told you Caesar was ambitious. If it were so, it was a grievous fault, And grievously hath Caesar answered it. Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest (For Brutus is an honorable man; So are they all, all honorable men), Come I to speak in Caesar’s funeral. He was my friend, faithful and just to me, But Brutus says he was ambitious, And Brutus is an honorable man. He hath brought many captives home to Rome, Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill. Did this in Caesar seem ambitious? When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept; Ambition should be made of sterner stuff. Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, And Brutus is an honorable man. You all did see that on the Lupercal I thrice presented him a kingly crown, Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, And sure he is an honorable man. I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, But here I am to speak what I do know. You all did love him once, not without cause. What cause withholds you, then, to mourn for him?— O judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar, And I must pause till it come back to me. He weeps. Methinks there is much reason in his sayings. If thou consider rightly of the matter, Caesar has had great wrong. Has he, masters? I fear there will a worse come in his place. Marked you his words? He would not take the crown; Therefore ’tis certain he was not ambitious. If it be found so, some will dear abide it. Poor soul, his eyes are red as fire with weeping. There’s not a nobler man in Rome than Antony. Now mark him. He begins again to speak. But yesterday the word of Caesar might Have stood against the world. Now lies he there, And none so poor to do him reverence. O masters, if I were disposed to stir Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage, I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong, Who, you all know, are honorable men. I will not do them wrong. I rather choose To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you, Than I will wrong such honorable men. But here’s a parchment with the seal of Caesar. I found it in his closet. ’Tis his will. Let but the commons hear this testament, Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read, And they would go and kiss dead Caesar’s wounds And dip their napkins in his sacred blood— Yea, beg a hair of him for memory And, dying, mention it within their wills, Bequeathing it as a rich legacy Unto their issue. We’ll hear the will. Read it, Mark Antony. The will, the will! We will hear Caesar’s will. Have patience, gentle friends. I must not read it. It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you. You are not wood, you are not stones, but men. And, being men, hearing the will of Caesar, It will inflame you; it will make you mad. ’Tis good you know not that you are his heirs, For if you should, O, what would come of it? Read the will! We’ll hear it, Antony. You shall read us the will, Caesar’s will. Will you be patient? Will you stay awhile? I have o’ershot myself to tell you of it. I fear I wrong the honorable men Whose daggers have stabbed Caesar. I do fear it. They were traitors. Honorable men? The will! The testament! They were villains, murderers. The will! Read the will. You will compel me, then, to read the will? Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar, And let me show you him that made the will. Shall I descend? And will you give me leave? Come down. Descend. You shall have leave. Antony descends. A ring; stand round. Stand from the hearse. Stand from the body. Room for Antony, most noble Antony. Nay, press not so upon me. Stand far off. Stand back! Room! Bear back! If you have tears, prepare to shed them now. You all do know this mantle. I remember The first time ever Caesar put it on. ’Twas on a summer’s evening in his tent, That day he overcame the Nervii. Look, in this place ran Cassius’ dagger through. See what a rent the envious Casca made. Through this the well-belovèd Brutus stabbed, And, as he plucked his cursèd steel away, Mark how the blood of Caesar followed it, As rushing out of doors to be resolved If Brutus so unkindly knocked or no; For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar’s angel. Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him! This was the most unkindest cut of all. For when the noble Caesar saw him stab, Ingratitude, more strong than traitors’ arms, Quite vanquished him. Then burst his mighty heart, And, in his mantle muffling up his face, Even at the base of Pompey’s statue (Which all the while ran blood) great Caesar fell. what a fall was there, my countrymen! Then I and you and all of us fell down, Whilst bloody treason flourished over us. now you weep, and I perceive you feel The dint of pity. These are gracious drops. Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold Our Caesar’s vesture wounded? Look you here, Antony lifts Caesar’s cloak. Here is himself, marred as you see with traitors. O piteous spectacle! O noble Caesar! O woeful day! O traitors, villains! O most bloody sight! We will be revenged. Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill! Slay! Let not a traitor live! Stay, countrymen. Peace there! Hear the noble Antony. We’ll hear him, we’ll follow him, we’ll die with him. Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up To such a sudden flood of mutiny. They that have done this deed are honorable. What private griefs they have, alas, I know not, That made them do it. They are wise and honorable And will no doubt with reasons answer you. I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts. I am no orator, as Brutus is, But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man That love my friend, and that they know full well That gave me public leave to speak of him. For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth, Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech To stir men’s blood. I only speak right on. I tell you that which you yourselves do know, Show you sweet Caesar’s wounds, poor poor dumb mouths, And bid them speak for me. But were I Brutus, And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue In every wound of Caesar that should move The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny. We’ll mutiny. We’ll burn the house of Brutus. Away then. Come, seek the conspirators. Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak. Peace, ho! Hear Antony, most noble Antony! Why, friends, you go to do you know not what. Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves? Alas, you know not. I must tell you then. You have forgot the will I told you of. Most true. The will! Let’s stay and hear the will. Here is the will, and under Caesar’s seal: To every Roman citizen he gives, To every several man, seventy-five drachmas. Most noble Caesar! We’ll revenge his death. O royal Caesar! Hear me with patience. Peace, ho! Moreover, he hath left you all his walks, His private arbors, and new-planted orchards, On this side Tiber. He hath left them you, And to your heirs forever—common pleasures To walk abroad and recreate yourselves. Here was a Caesar! When comes such another? Never, never!—Come, away, away! We’ll burn his body in the holy place And with the brands fire the traitors’ houses. Take up the body. Go fetch fire. Pluck down benches. Pluck down forms, windows, anything.

Grant that, and then is death a benefit. So are we Caesar’s friends, that have abridged His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop, And let us bathe our hands in Caesar’s blood Up to the elbows and besmear our swords. Then walk we forth, even to the marketplace, And, waving our red weapons o’er our heads, Let’s all cry “Peace, freedom, and liberty!” Stoop then, and wash. They smear their hands and swords with Caesar’s blood. How many ages hence Shall this our lofty scene be acted over In states unborn and accents yet unknown! How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport, That now on Pompey’s basis lies along No worthier than the dust! So oft as that shall be, So often shall the knot of us be called The men that gave their country liberty. What, shall we forth? Ay, every man away. Brutus shall lead, and we will grace his heels With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome. Enter a Servant. Soft, who comes here? A friend of Antony’s. kneeling Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel. Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down, And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say: Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest; Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving. Say, I love Brutus, and I honor him; Say, I feared Caesar, honored him, and loved him. If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony May safely come to him and be resolved How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death, Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead So well as Brutus living, but will follow The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus Thorough the hazards of this untrod state With all true faith. So says my master Antony. Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman. I never thought him worse. Tell him, so please him come unto this place, He shall be satisfied and, by my honor, Depart untouched. I’ll fetch him presently. Servant exits. I know that we shall have him well to friend. I wish we may; but yet have I a mind That fears him much, and my misgiving still Falls shrewdly to the purpose. Enter Antony. But here comes Antony.—Welcome, Mark Antony! O mighty Caesar, dost thou lie so low? Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.— I know not, gentlemen, what you intend, Who else must be let blood, who else is rank. If I myself, there is no hour so fit As Caesar’s death’s hour, nor no instrument Of half that worth as those your swords made rich With the most noble blood of all this world. I do beseech you, if you bear me hard, Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke, Fulfill your pleasure. Live a thousand years, I shall not find myself so apt to die; No place will please me so, no mean of death, As here by Caesar, and by you cut off, The choice and master spirits of this age. O Antony, beg not your death of us! Though now we must appear bloody and cruel, As by our hands and this our present act You see we do, yet see you but our hands And this the bleeding business they have done. Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful; And pity to the general wrong of Rome (As fire drives out fire, so pity pity) Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part, To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony. Our arms in strength of malice, and our hearts Of brothers’ temper, do receive you in With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence. Your voice shall be as strong as any man’s In the disposing of new dignities. Only be patient till we have appeased The multitude, beside themselves with fear; And then we will deliver you the cause Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him, Have thus proceeded. I doubt not of your wisdom. Let each man render me his bloody hand. First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you.— Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand.— Now, Decius Brutus, yours;—now yours, Metellus;— Yours, Cinna;—and, my valiant Casca, yours;— Though last, not least in love, yours, good Trebonius.— Gentlemen all—alas, what shall I say? My credit now stands on such slippery ground That one of two bad ways you must conceit me, Either a coward or a flatterer.— That I did love thee, Caesar, O, ’tis true! If then thy spirit look upon us now, Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death To see thy Antony making his peace, Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes— Most noble!—in the presence of thy corpse? Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds, Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood, It would become me better than to close In terms of friendship with thine enemies. Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bayed, brave hart, Here didst thou fall, and here thy hunters stand Signed in thy spoil and crimsoned in thy Lethe. O world, thou wast the forest to this hart, And this indeed, O world, the heart of thee. How like a deer strucken by many princes Dost thou here lie! Mark Antony— Pardon me, Caius Cassius. The enemies of Caesar shall say this; Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty. I blame you not for praising Caesar so. But what compact mean you to have with us? Will you be pricked in number of our friends, Or shall we on and not depend on you? Therefore I took your hands, but was indeed Swayed from the point by looking down on Caesar. Friends am I with you all and love you all, Upon this hope, that you shall give me reasons Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous. Or else were this a savage spectacle. Our reasons are so full of good regard That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar, You should be satisfied. That’s all I seek; And am, moreover, suitor that I may Produce his body to the marketplace, And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend, Speak in the order of his funeral. You shall, Mark Antony. Brutus, a word with you. Aside to Brutus. You know not what you do. Do not consent That Antony speak in his funeral. Know you how much the people may be moved By that which he will utter? aside to Cassius By your pardon, I will myself into the pulpit first And show the reason of our Caesar’s death. What Antony shall speak I will protest He speaks by leave and by permission, And that we are contented Caesar shall Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies. It shall advantage more than do us wrong. aside to Brutus I know not what may fall. I like it not. Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar’s body. You shall not in your funeral speech blame us But speak all good you can devise of Caesar And say you do ’t by our permission, Else shall you not have any hand at all About his funeral. And you shall speak In the same pulpit whereto I am going, After my speech is ended. Be it so. I do desire no more. Prepare the body, then, and follow us. All but Antony exit. O pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth, That I am meek and gentle with these butchers. Thou art the ruins of the noblest man That ever livèd in the tide of times. Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood! Over thy wounds now do I prophesy (Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue) A curse shall light upon the limbs of men; Domestic fury and fierce civil strife Shall cumber all the parts of Italy; Blood and destruction shall be so in use And dreadful objects so familiar That mothers shall but smile when they behold Their infants quartered with the hands of war, All pity choked with custom of fell deeds; And Caesar’s spirit, ranging for revenge, With Ate by his side come hot from hell, Shall in these confines with a monarch’s voice Cry “Havoc!” and let slip the dogs of war, That this foul deed shall smell above the earth With carrion men groaning for burial. Enter Octavius’ Servant. You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not? do, Mark Antony. Caesar did write for him to come to Rome. He did receive his letters and is coming, And bid me say to you by word of mouth— O Caesar! Thy heart is big. Get thee apart and weep. Passion, I see, is catching, for mine eyes, Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine, Began to water. Is thy master coming? He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome. Post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced. Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome, No Rome of safety for Octavius yet. Hie hence and tell him so.—Yet stay awhile; Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corpse Into the marketplace. There shall I try, In my oration, how the people take The cruel issue of these bloody men, According to the which thou shalt discourse To young Octavius of the state of things. Lend me your hand. They exit with Caesar’s body.",
      "Enter Portia and Lucius. I prithee, boy, run to the Senate House. Stay not to answer me, but get thee gone. Why dost thou stay? To know my errand, madam. I would have had thee there and here again Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there. Aside. O constancy, be strong upon my side; Set a huge mountain ’tween my heart and tongue. I have a man’s mind but a woman’s might. How hard it is for women to keep counsel!— Art thou here yet? Madam, what should I do? Run to the Capitol, and nothing else? And so return to you, and nothing else? Yes, bring me word, boy, if thy lord look well, For he went sickly forth. And take good note What Caesar doth, what suitors press to him. Hark, boy, what noise is that? I hear none, madam. Prithee, listen well. I heard a bustling rumor like a fray, And the wind brings it from the Capitol. Sooth, madam, I hear nothing. Enter the Soothsayer. Come hither, fellow. Which way hast thou been? At mine own house, good lady. What is ’t o’clock? About the ninth hour, lady. Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol? Madam, not yet. I go to take my stand To see him pass on to the Capitol. Thou hast some suit to Caesar, hast thou not? That I have, lady. If it will please Caesar To be so good to Caesar as to hear me, I shall beseech him to befriend himself. Why, know’st thou any harm’s intended towards him? None that I know will be, much that I fear may chance. Good morrow to you.—Here the street is narrow. The throng that follows Caesar at the heels, Of senators, of praetors, common suitors, Will crowd a feeble man almost to death. I’ll get me to a place more void, and there Speak to great Caesar as he comes along. He exits. I must go in. Aside. Ay me, how weak a thing The heart of woman is! O Brutus, The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise! Sure the boy heard me. To Lucius. Brutus hath a suit That Caesar will not grant. Aside. O, I grow faint.— Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord. Say I am merry. Come to me again And bring me word what he doth say to thee. They exit separately.",
      "Driven by ambition and a desire to defy fate, Caesar initially dismisses Calphurnia's fears and ominous omens, showcasing his hubris and a belief in his own invincibility. Calphurnia's emotional pleas and vivid descriptions of disturbing events highlight her genuine fear for Caesar's life and the potential consequences for Rome. Decius Brutus manipulates Caesar's ego by reinterpreting Calphurnia's dream and appealing to his fear of appearing weak, ultimately convincing him to attend the Senate. This manipulation underscores the political tension and the conspirators' calculated strategy to exploit Caesar's vulnerabilities. Caesar's decision to disregard his wife's warnings, influenced by Decius's persuasive arguments, sets in motion the events that lead to his assassination.",
      "The scene establishes political tension through Flavius and Marullus's disdain for the commoners' fickle loyalty, shifting from Pompey to Caesar. Their harsh reprimands and accusations of ingratitude reveal a fear of Caesar's growing power and the potential for tyranny. This fear motivates their actions to diminish Caesar's celebration by dispersing the crowd and removing his decorations. The commoners' initial enthusiasm, contrasted with their later guilt and dispersal, highlights their susceptibility to manipulation and the fragility of popular opinion.",
      "Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause, Lest I be laughed at when I tell them so. The cause is in my will. I will not come. That is enough to satisfy the Senate. But for your private satisfaction, Because I love you, I will let you know. Calphurnia here, my wife, stays me at home. She dreamt tonight she saw my statue, Which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts, Did run pure blood; and many lusty Romans Came smiling and did bathe their hands in it. And these does she apply for warnings and portents And evils imminent, and on her knee Hath begged that I will stay at home today. This dream is all amiss interpreted. It was a vision fair and fortunate. Your statue spouting blood in many pipes, In which so many smiling Romans bathed, Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck Reviving blood, and that great men shall press For tinctures, stains, relics, and cognizance. This by Calphurnia’s dream is signified. And this way have you well expounded it. I have, when you have heard what I can say. And know it now: the Senate have concluded To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar. If you shall send them word you will not come, Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock Apt to be rendered, for someone to say “Break up the Senate till another time, When Caesar’s wife shall meet with better dreams.” If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper “Lo, Caesar is afraid”? Pardon me, Caesar, for my dear dear love To your proceeding bids me tell you this, And reason to my love is liable.",
      "They would not have you to stir forth today. Plucking the entrails of an offering forth, They could not find a heart within the beast. The gods do this in shame of cowardice. Caesar should be a beast without a heart If he should stay at home today for fear. No, Caesar shall not. Danger knows full well That Caesar is more dangerous than he. We are two lions littered in one day, And I the elder and more terrible. And Caesar shall go forth. Alas, my lord, Your wisdom is consumed in confidence. Do not go forth today. Call it my fear That keeps you in the house, and not your own. We’ll send Mark Antony to the Senate House, And he shall say you are not well today. Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this. She kneels. Mark Antony shall say I am not well, And for thy humor I will stay at home. He lifts her up. Enter Decius. Here’s Decius Brutus; he shall tell them so.",

    "ground_truth": "She has had nightmares about his death",
    "answer": "Calphurnia urges Caesar to stay home due to a disturbing dream where she saw his statue spouting blood, with Romans bathing their hands in it, which she interprets as a warning (Act 2, Scene 2). She also mentions the priests could not find a heart within the beast they sacrificed (Act 2, Scene 2). She fears these are omens of \"evils imminent\" (Act 2, Scene 2)."

      "Enter Caesar, Antony for the course, Calphurnia, Portia, Decius, Cicero, Brutus, Cassius, Casca, a Soothsayer; after them Marullus and Flavius and Commoners. Calphurnia. Peace, ho! Caesar speaks. Calphurnia. Here, my lord. Stand you directly in Antonius’ way When he doth run his course.—Antonius. Caesar, my lord. Forget not in your speed, Antonius, To touch Calphurnia, for our elders say The barren, touchèd in this holy chase, Shake off their sterile curse. I shall remember. When Caesar says “Do this,” it is performed. Set on and leave no ceremony out. Sennet. Caesar. Ha! Who calls? Bid every noise be still. Peace, yet again! Who is it in the press that calls on me? I hear a tongue shriller than all the music Cry “Caesar.” Speak. Caesar is turned to hear. Beware the ides of March. What man is that? A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March. Set him before me. Let me see his face. Fellow, come from the throng. The Soothsayer comes forward. Look upon Caesar. What sayst thou to me now? Speak once again. Beware the ides of March. He is a dreamer. Let us leave him. Pass. Sennet. All but Brutus and Cassius exit. Will you go see the order of the course? Not I. I pray you, do. I am not gamesome. I do lack some part Of that quick spirit that is in Antony. Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires. I’ll leave you. Brutus, I do observe you now of late. I have not from your eyes that gentleness And show of love as I was wont to have. You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand Over your friend that loves you. Cassius, Be not deceived. If I have veiled my look, I turn the trouble of my countenance Merely upon myself. Vexèd I am Of late with passions of some difference, Conceptions only proper to myself, Which give some soil, perhaps, to my behaviors. But let not therefore my good friends be grieved (Among which number, Cassius, be you one) Nor construe any further my neglect Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war, Forgets the shows of love to other men. Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion, By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations. Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face? No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself But by reflection, by some other things. ’Tis just. And it is very much lamented, Brutus, That you have no such mirrors as will turn Your hidden worthiness into your eye, That you might see your shadow. I have heard Where many of the best respect in Rome, Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus And groaning underneath this age’s yoke, Have wished that noble Brutus had his eyes. Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius, That you would have me seek into myself For that which is not in me? Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear. And since you know you cannot see yourself So well as by reflection, I, your glass, Will modestly discover to yourself That of yourself which you yet know not of. And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus. Were I a common laughter, or did use To stale with ordinary oaths my love To every new protester; if you know That I do fawn on men and hug them hard And after scandal them, or if you know That I profess myself in banqueting To all the rout, then hold me dangerous. Flourish and shout. What means this shouting? I do fear the people Choose Caesar for their king. Ay, do you fear it? Then must I think you would not have it so. I would not, Cassius, yet I love him well. But wherefore do you hold me here so long? What is it that you would impart to me? If it be aught toward the general good, Set honor in one eye and death i’ th’ other And I will look on both indifferently; For let the gods so speed me as I love The name of honor more than I fear death. I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus, As well as I do know your outward favor. Well, honor is the subject of my story. I cannot tell what you and other men Think of this life; but, for my single self, I had as lief not be as live to be In awe of such a thing as I myself. I was born free as Caesar; so were you; We both have fed as well, and we can both Endure the winter’s cold as well as he. For once, upon a raw and gusty day, The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores, Caesar said to me “Dar’st thou, Cassius, now Leap in with me into this angry flood And swim to yonder point?” Upon the word, Accoutered as I was, I plungèd in And bade him follow; so indeed he did. The torrent roared, and we did buffet it With lusty sinews, throwing it aside And stemming it with hearts of controversy. But ere we could arrive the point proposed, Caesar cried “Help me, Cassius, or I sink!” as Aeneas, our great ancestor, Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber Did I the tired Caesar. And this man Is now become a god, and Cassius is A wretched creature and must bend his body If Caesar carelessly but nod on him. He had a fever when he was in Spain, And when the fit was on him, I did mark How he did shake. ’Tis true, this god did shake. His coward lips did from their color fly, And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world Did lose his luster. I did hear him groan. Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans Mark him and write his speeches in their books, “Alas,” it cried “Give me some drink, Titinius” As a sick girl. You gods, it doth amaze me A man of such a feeble temper should So get the start of the majestic world And bear the palm alone. Shout. Flourish. Another general shout! I do believe that these applauses are For some new honors that are heaped on Caesar. Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world Like a Colossus, and we petty men Walk under his huge legs and peep about To find ourselves dishonorable graves. Men at some time are masters of their fates. The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, But in ourselves, that we are underlings. “Brutus” and “Caesar”—what should be in that “Caesar”? Why should that name be sounded more than yours? Write them together, yours is as fair a name; Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well; Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with ’em, “Brutus” will start a spirit as soon as “Caesar.” Now, in the names of all the gods at once, Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed! Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods! When went there by an age, since the great flood, But it was famed with more than with one man? When could they say, till now, that talked of Rome, That her wide walks encompassed but one man? Now is it Rome indeed, and room enough When there is in it but one only man. you and I have heard our fathers say There was a Brutus once that would have brooked Th’ eternal devil to keep his state in Rome As easily as a king. That you do love me, I am nothing jealous. What you would work me to, I have some aim. How I have thought of this, and of these times, I shall recount hereafter. For this present, I would not, so with love I might entreat you, Be any further moved. What you have said I will consider; what you have to say I will with patience hear, and find a time Both meet to hear and answer such high things. Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this: Brutus had rather be a villager Than to repute himself a son of Rome Under these hard conditions as this time Is like to lay upon us. I am glad that my weak words Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus. Enter Caesar and his train. The games are done, and Caesar is returning. As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve, And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you What hath proceeded worthy note today. I will do so. But look you, Cassius, The angry spot doth glow on Caesar’s brow, And all the rest look like a chidden train. Calphurnia’s cheek is pale, and Cicero Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes As we have seen him in the Capitol, Being crossed in conference by some senators. Casca will tell us what the matter is. Antonius. Caesar. Let me have men about me that are fat, Sleek-headed men, and such as sleep a-nights. Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look. He thinks too much. Such men are dangerous. Fear him not, Caesar; he’s not dangerous. He is a noble Roman, and well given. Would he were fatter! But I fear him not. Yet if my name were liable to fear, I do not know the man I should avoid So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much, He is a great observer, and he looks Quite through the deeds of men. He loves no plays, As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music; Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort As if he mocked himself and scorned his spirit That could be moved to smile at anything. Such men as he be never at heart’s ease Whiles they behold a greater than themselves, And therefore are they very dangerous. I rather tell thee what is to be feared Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar. Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf, And tell me truly what thou think’st of him. Sennet. Caesar and his train exit but Casca remains behind. You pulled me by the cloak. Would you speak with me? Ay, Casca. Tell us what hath chanced today That Caesar looks so sad. Why, you were with him, were you not? I should not then ask Casca what had chanced. Why, there was a crown offered him; and, being offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand, thus, and then the people fell a-shouting. What was the second noise for? Why, for that too. They shouted thrice. What was the last cry for? Why, for that too. Was the crown offered him thrice? Ay, marry, was ’t, and he put it by thrice, every time gentler than other; and at every putting-by, mine honest neighbors shouted. Who offered him the crown? Why, Antony. Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca. I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it. It was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown (yet ’twas not a crown neither; ’twas one of these coronets), and, as I told you, he put it by once; but for all that, to my thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he offered it to him again; then he put it by again; but to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it. And then he offered it the third time. He put it the third time by, and still as he refused it the rabblement hooted and clapped their chopped hands and threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked Caesar, for he swooned and fell down at it. And for mine own part, I durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air. But soft, I pray you. What, did Caesar swoon? He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and was speechless. ’Tis very like; he hath the falling sickness. No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness. I know not what you mean by that, but I am sure Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and displeased them, as they use to do the players in the theater, I am no true man. What said he when he came unto himself? Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common herd was glad he refused the crown, he plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his throat to cut. An I had been a man of any occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word, I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so he fell. When he came to himself again, he said if he had done or said anything amiss, he desired their Worships to think it was his infirmity. Three or four wenches where I stood cried “Alas, good soul!” and forgave him with all their hearts. But there’s no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less. And, after that, he came thus sad away? Ay. Did Cicero say anything? Ay, he spoke Greek. To what effect? Nay, an I tell you that, I’ll ne’er look you i’ th’ face again. But those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads. But for mine own part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarves off Caesar’s images, are put to silence. Fare you well. There was more foolery yet, if I could remember it. Will you sup with me tonight, Casca? No, I am promised forth. Will you dine with me tomorrow? Ay, if I be alive, and your mind hold, and your dinner worth the eating. Good. I will expect you. Do so. Farewell both. He exits. What a blunt fellow is this grown to be! He was quick mettle when he went to school. So is he now in execution Of any bold or noble enterprise, However he puts on this tardy form. This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit, Which gives men stomach to digest his words With better appetite. And so it is. For this time I will leave you. Tomorrow, if you please to speak with me, I will come home to you; or, if you will, Come home to me, and I will wait for you. I will do so. Till then, think of the world. Brutus exits. Well, Brutus, thou art noble. Yet I see Thy honorable mettle may be wrought From that it is disposed. Therefore it is meet That noble minds keep ever with their likes; For who so firm that cannot be seduced? Caesar doth bear me hard, but he loves Brutus. If I were Brutus now, and he were Cassius, He should not humor me. I will this night In several hands in at his windows throw, As if they came from several citizens, Writings, all tending to the great opinion That Rome holds of his name, wherein obscurely Caesar’s ambition shall be glancèd at And after this, let Caesar seat him sure, For we will shake him, or worse days endure. He exits.",

O Caesar, read mine first, for mine’s a suit That touches Caesar nearer. Read it, great Caesar. What touches us ourself shall be last served. Delay not, Caesar; read it instantly. What, is the fellow mad? Sirrah, give place. What, urge you your petitions in the street? Come to the Capitol. Caesar goes forward, the rest following. to Cassius I wish your enterprise today may thrive. What enterprise, Popilius? Fare you well. He walks away. What said Popilius Lena? He wished today our enterprise might thrive. I fear our purpose is discoverèd. Look how he makes to Caesar. Mark him. Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention.— Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known, Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back, For I will slay myself. Cassius, be constant. Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes, For look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change. Trebonius knows his time, for look you, Brutus, He draws Mark Antony out of the way. Trebonius and Antony exit. Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him go And presently prefer his suit to Caesar. He is addressed. Press near and second him. Casca, you are the first that rears your hand. Are we all ready? What is now amiss That Caesar and his Senate must redress? kneeling Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar, Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat An humble heart. I must prevent thee, Cimber. These couchings and these lowly courtesies Might fire the blood of ordinary men And turn preordinance and first decree Into the law of children. Be not fond To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood That will be thawed from the true quality With that which melteth fools—I mean sweet words, Low-crookèd curtsies, and base spaniel fawning. Thy brother by decree is banishèd. If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him, I spurn thee like a cur out of my way. Know: Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause Will he be satisfied. Is there no voice more worthy than my own To sound more sweetly in great Caesar’s ear For the repealing of my banished brother? kneeling I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar, Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may Have an immediate freedom of repeal. What, Brutus? kneeling Pardon, Caesar; Caesar, pardon! As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber. I could be well moved, if I were as you. If I could pray to move, prayers would move me. But I am constant as the Northern Star, Of whose true fixed and resting quality There is no fellow in the firmament. The skies are painted with unnumbered sparks; They are all fire, and every one doth shine. But there’s but one in all doth hold his place. So in the world: ’tis furnished well with men, And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive. Yet in the number I do know but one That unassailable holds on his rank, Unshaked of motion; and that I am he Let me a little show it, even in this: That I was constant Cimber should be banished And constant do remain to keep him so. kneeling O Caesar— Hence. Wilt thou lift up Olympus? kneeling Great Caesar— Doth not Brutus bootless kneel? Speak, hands, for me! As Casca strikes, the others rise up and stab Caesar. Et tu, Brutè?—Then fall, Caesar. He dies. Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead! Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets. Some to the common pulpits and cry out “Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement.” People and Senators, be not affrighted. Fly not; stand still. Ambition’s debt is paid. Go to the pulpit, Brutus. And Cassius too. Where’s Publius? Here, quite confounded with this mutiny. Stand fast together, lest some friend of Caesar’s Should chance— Talk not of standing.—Publius, good cheer. There is no harm intended to your person, Nor to no Roman else. So tell them, Publius. And leave us, Publius, lest that the people, Rushing on us, should do your age some mischief. Do so, and let no man abide this deed But we the doers. All but the Conspirators exit. Enter Trebonius. Where is Antony? TREBONIUS Fled to his house amazed. Men, wives, and children stare, cry out, and run As it were doomsday. BRUTUS Fates, we will know your pleasures. That we shall die we know; ’tis but the time, And drawing days out, that men stand upon. Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life Cuts off so many years of fearing death. Grant that, and then is death a benefit. So are we Caesar’s friends, that have abridged His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop, And let us bathe our hands in Caesar’s blood Up to the elbows and besmear our swords. Then walk we forth, even to the marketplace, And, waving our red weapons o’er our heads, Let’s all cry “Peace, freedom, and liberty!” Stoop then, and wash. They smear their hands and swords with Caesar’s blood. How many ages hence Shall this our lofty scene be acted over In states unborn and accents yet unknown! How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport, That now on Pompey’s basis lies along No worthier than the dust! So oft as that shall be, So often shall the knot of us be called The men that gave their country liberty. What, shall we forth? Ay, every man away. Brutus shall lead, and we will grace his heels With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome. Enter a Servant. Soft, who comes here? A friend of Antony’s. kneeling Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel. Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down, And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say: Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest; Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving. Say, I love Brutus, and I honor him; Say, I feared Caesar, honored him, and loved him. If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony May safely come to him and be resolved How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death, Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead So well as Brutus living, but will follow The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus Thorough the hazards of this untrod state With all true faith. So says my master Antony. Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman. I never thought him worse. Tell him, so please him come unto this place, He shall be satisfied and, by my honor, Depart untouched. I’ll fetch him presently. Servant exits. I know that we shall have him well to friend. I wish we may; but yet have I a mind That fears him much, and my misgiving still Falls shrewdly to the purpose. Enter Antony. But here comes Antony.—Welcome, Mark Antony! O mighty Caesar, dost thou lie so low? Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.— I know not, gentlemen, what you intend, Who else must be let blood, who else is rank. If I myself, there is no hour so fit As Caesar’s death’s hour, nor no instrument Of half that worth as those your swords made rich With the most noble blood of all this world. I do beseech you, if you bear me hard, Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke, Fulfill your pleasure. Live a thousand years, I shall not find myself so apt to die; No place will please me so, no mean of death, As here by Caesar, and by you cut off, The choice and master spirits of this age. O Antony, beg not your death of us! Though now we must appear bloody and cruel, As by our hands and this our present act You see we do, yet see you but our hands And this the bleeding business they have done. Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful; And pity to the general wrong of Rome (As fire drives out fire, so pity pity) Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part, To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony. Our arms in strength of malice, and our hearts Of brothers’ temper, do receive you in With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence. Your voice shall be as strong as any man’s In the disposing of new dignities. Only be patient till we have appeased The multitude, beside themselves with fear; And then we will deliver you the cause Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him, Have thus proceeded. I doubt not of your wisdom. Let each man render me his bloody hand. First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you.— Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand.— Now, Decius Brutus, yours;—now yours, Metellus;— Yours, Cinna;—and, my valiant Casca, yours;— Though last, not least in love, yours, good Trebonius.— Gentlemen all—alas, what shall I say? My credit now stands on such slippery ground That one of two bad ways you must conceit me, Either a coward or a flatterer.— That I did love thee, Caesar, O, ’tis true! If then thy spirit look upon us now, Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death To see thy Antony making his peace, Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes— Most noble!—in the presence of thy corpse? Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds, Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood, It would become me better than to close In terms of friendship with thine enemies. Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bayed, brave hart, Here didst thou fall, and here thy hunters stand Signed in thy spoil and crimsoned in thy Lethe. O world, thou wast the forest to this hart, And this indeed, O world, the heart of thee. How like a deer strucken by many princes Dost thou here lie! Mark Antony— Pardon me, Caius Cassius. The enemies of Caesar shall say this; Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty. I blame you not for praising Caesar so. But what compact mean you to have with us? Will you be pricked in number of our friends, Or shall we on and not depend on you? Therefore I took your hands, but was indeed Swayed from the point by looking down on Caesar. Friends am I with you all and love you all, Upon this hope, that you shall give me reasons Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous. Or else were this a savage spectacle. Our reasons are so full of good regard That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar, You should be satisfied. That’s all I seek; And am, moreover, suitor that I may Produce his body to the marketplace, And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend, Speak in the order of his funeral. You shall, Mark Antony. Brutus, a word with you. Aside to Brutus. You know not what you do. Do not consent That Antony speak in his funeral. Know you how much the people may be moved By that which he will utter? aside to Cassius By your pardon, I will myself into the pulpit first And show the reason of our Caesar’s death. What Antony shall speak I will protest He speaks by leave and by permission, And that we are contented Caesar shall Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies. It shall advantage more than do us wrong. aside to Brutus I know not what may fall. I like it not. Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar’s body. You shall not in your funeral speech blame us But speak all good you can devise of Caesar And say you do ’t by our permission, Else shall you not have any hand at all About his funeral. And you shall speak In the same pulpit whereto I am going, After my speech is ended. Be it so. I do desire no more. Prepare the body, then, and follow us. All but Antony exit. O pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth, That I am meek and gentle with these butchers. Thou art the ruins of the noblest man That ever livèd in the tide of times. Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood! Over thy wounds now do I prophesy (Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue) A curse shall light upon the limbs of men; Domestic fury and fierce civil strife Shall cumber all the parts of Italy; Blood and destruction shall be so in use And dreadful objects so familiar That mothers shall but smile when they behold Their infants quartered with the hands of war, All pity choked with custom of fell deeds; And Caesar’s spirit, ranging for revenge, With Ate by his side come hot from hell, Shall in these confines with a monarch’s voice Cry “Havoc!” and let slip the dogs of war, That this foul deed shall smell above the earth With carrion men groaning for burial. Enter Octavius’ Servant. You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not? do, Mark Antony. Caesar did write for him to come to Rome. He did receive his letters and is coming, And bid me say to you by word of mouth— O Caesar! Thy heart is big. Get thee apart and weep. Passion, I see, is catching, for mine eyes, Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine, Began to water. Is thy master coming? He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome. Post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced. Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome, No Rome of safety for Octavius yet. Hie hence and tell him so.—Yet stay awhile; Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corpse Into the marketplace. There shall I try, In my oration, how the people take The cruel issue of these bloody men, According to the which thou shalt discourse To young Octavius of the state of things. Lend me your hand.

Forget not in your speed, Antonius, To touch Calphurnia, for our elders say The barren, touchèd in this holy chase, Shake off their sterile curse. I shall remember.

I do lack some part Of that quick spirit that is in Antony. Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires. I’ll leave you. Brutus, I do observe you now of late. I have not from your eyes that gentleness And show of love as I was wont to have. You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand Over your friend that loves you. Cassius, Be not deceived. If I have veiled my look, I turn the trouble of my countenance Merely upon myself. Vexèd I am Of late with passions of some difference, Conceptions only proper to myself, Which give some soil, perhaps, to my behaviors. But let not therefore my good friends be grieved (Among which number, Cassius, be you one) Nor construe any further my neglect Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war, Forgets the shows of love to other men. Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion, By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations. Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face? No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself But by reflection, by some other things. ’Tis just. And it is very much lamented, Brutus, That you have no such mirrors as will turn Your hidden worthiness into your eye, That you might see your shadow. I have heard Where many of the best respect in Rome, Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus And groaning underneath this age’s yoke, Have wished that noble Brutus had his eyes. Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius, That you would have me seek into myself For that which is not in me? Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear. And since you know you cannot see yourself So well as by reflection, I, your glass, Will modestly discover to yourself That of yourself which you yet know not of. And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus. Were I a common laughter, or did use To stale with ordinary oaths my love To every new protester; if you know That I do fawn on men and hug them hard And after scandal them, or if you know That I profess myself in banqueting To all the rout, then hold me dangerous. Flourish and shout. What means this shouting? I do fear the people Choose Caesar for their king. Ay, do you fear it? Then must I think you would not have it so. I would not, Cassius, yet I love him well. But wherefore do you hold me here so long? What is it that you would impart to me? If it be aught toward the general good, Set honor in one eye and death i’ th’ other And I will look on both indifferently; For let the gods so speed me as I love The name of honor more than I fear death. I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus, As well as I do know your outward favor. Well, honor is the subject of my story. I cannot tell what you and other men Think of this life; but, for my single self, I had as lief not be as live to be In awe of such a thing as I myself. I was born free as Caesar; so were you; We both have fed as well, and we can both Endure the winter’s cold as well as he. For once, upon a raw and gusty day, The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores, Caesar said to me “Dar’st thou, Cassius, now Leap in with me into this angry flood And swim to yonder point?” Upon the word, Accoutered as I was, I plungèd in And bade him follow; so indeed he did. The torrent roared, and we did buffet it With lusty sinews, throwing it aside And stemming it with hearts of controversy. But ere we could arrive the point proposed, Caesar cried “Help me, Cassius, or I sink!” as Aeneas, our great ancestor, Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber Did I the tired Caesar. And this man Is now become a god, and Cassius is A wretched creature and must bend his body If Caesar carelessly but nod on him. He had a fever when he was in Spain, And when the fit was on him, I did mark How he did shake. ’Tis true, this god did shake. His coward lips did from their color fly, And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world Did lose his luster. I did hear him groan. Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans Mark him and write his speeches in their books, “Alas,” it cried “Give me some drink, Titinius” As a sick girl. You gods, it doth amaze me A man of such a feeble temper should So get the start of the majestic world And bear the palm alone. Shout. Flourish. Another general shout! I do believe that these applauses are For some new honors that are heaped on Caesar. Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world Like a Colossus, and we petty men Walk under his huge legs and peep about To find ourselves dishonorable graves. Men at some time are masters of their fates. The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, But in ourselves, that we are underlings. “Brutus” and “Caesar”—what should be in that “Caesar”? Why should that name be sounded more than yours? Write them together, yours is as fair a name; Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well; Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with ’em, “Brutus” will start a spirit as soon as “Caesar.” Now, in the names of all the gods at once, Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed! Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods! When went there by an age, since the great flood, But it was famed with more than with one man? When could they say, till now, that talked of Rome, That her wide walks encompassed but one man? Now is it Rome indeed, and room enough When there is in it but one only man. you and I have heard our fathers say There was a Brutus once that would have brooked Th’ eternal devil to keep his state in Rome As easily as a king. That you do love me, I am nothing jealous. What you would work me to, I have some aim. How I have thought of this, and of these times, I shall recount hereafter. For this present, I would not, so with love I might entreat you, Be any further moved. What you have said I will consider; what you have to say I will with patience hear, and find a time Both meet to hear and answer such high things. Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this: Brutus had rather be a villager Than to repute himself a son of Rome Under these hard conditions as this time Is like to lay upon us. I am glad that my weak words Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus. Enter Caesar and his train. The games are done, and Caesar is returning. As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve, And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you What hath proceeded worthy note today. I will do so. But look you, Cassius, The angry spot doth glow on Caesar’s brow, And all the rest look like a chidden train. Calphurnia’s cheek is pale, and Cicero Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes As we have seen him in the Capitol, Being crossed in conference by some senators. Casca will tell us what the matter is. Antonius. Caesar. Let me have men about me that are fat, Sleek-headed men, and such as sleep a-nights. Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look. He thinks too much. Such men are dangerous. Fear him not, Caesar; he’s not dangerous. He is a noble Roman, and well given. Would he were fatter! But I fear him not. Yet if my name were liable to fear, I do not know the man I should avoid So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much, He is a great observer, and he looks Quite through the deeds of men. He loves no plays, As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music; Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort As if he mocked himself and scorned his spirit That could be moved to smile at anything. Such men as he be never at heart’s ease Whiles they behold a greater than themselves, And therefore are they very dangerous. I rather tell thee what is to be feared Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar. Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf, And tell me truly what thou think’st of him. Sennet. Caesar and his train exit but Casca remains behind. You pulled me by the cloak. Would you speak with me? Ay, Casca. Tell us what hath chanced today That Caesar looks so sad. Why, you were with him, were you not? I should not then ask Casca what had chanced. Why, there was a crown offered him; and, being offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand, thus, and then the people fell a-shouting. What was the second noise for? Why, for that too. They shouted thrice. What was the last cry for? Why, for that too. Was the crown offered him thrice? Ay, marry, was ’t, and he put it by thrice, every time gentler than other; and at every putting-by, mine honest neighbors shouted. Who offered him the crown? Why, Antony. Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca. I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it. It was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown (yet ’twas not a crown neither; ’twas one of these coronets), and, as I told you, he put it by once; but for all that, to my thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he offered it to him again; then he put it by again; but to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it. And then he offered it the third time. He put it the third time by, and still as he refused it the rabblement hooted and clapped their chopped hands and threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked Caesar, for he swooned and fell down at it. And for mine own part, I durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air. But soft, I pray you. What, did Caesar swoon? He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and was speechless. ’Tis very like; he hath the falling sickness. No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness. I know not what you mean by that, but I am sure Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and displeased them, as they use to do the players in the theater, I am no true man. What said he when he came unto himself? Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common herd was glad he refused the crown, he plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his throat to cut. An I had been a man of any occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word, I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so he fell. When he came to himself again, he said if he had done or said anything amiss, he desired their Worships to think it was his infirmity. Three or four wenches where I stood cried “Alas, good soul!” and forgave him with all their hearts. But there’s no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less. And, after that, he came thus sad away? Ay. Did Cicero say anything? Ay, he spoke Greek. To what effect? Nay, an I tell you that, I’ll ne’er look you i’ th’ face again. But those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads. But for mine own part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarves off Caesar’s images, are put to silence. Fare you well. There was more foolery yet, if I could remember it. Will you sup with me tonight, Casca? No, I am promised forth. Will you dine with me tomorrow? Ay, if I be alive, and your mind hold, and your dinner worth the eating. Good. I will expect you. Do so. Farewell both. He exits. What a blunt fellow is this grown to be! He was quick mettle when he went to school. So is he now in execution Of any bold or noble enterprise, However he puts on this tardy form. This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit, Which gives men stomach to digest his words With better appetite. And so it is. For this time I will leave you. Tomorrow, if you please to speak with me, I will come home to you; or, if you will, Come home to me, and I will wait for you. I will do so. Till then, think of the world. Brutus exits. Well, Brutus, thou art noble. Yet I see Thy honorable mettle may be wrought From that it is disposed. Therefore it is meet That noble minds keep ever with their likes; For who so firm that cannot be seduced? Caesar doth bear me hard, but he loves Brutus. If I were Brutus now, and he were Cassius, He should not humor me. I will this night In several hands in at his windows throw, As if they came from several citizens, Writings, all tending to the great opinion That Rome holds of his name, wherein obscurely Caesar’s ambition shall be glancèd at And after this, let Caesar seat him sure, For we will shake him, or worse days endure. He exits.",
      "Flourish. Enter Caesar, Antony, Lepidus; Brutus, Cassius, Casca, Decius, Metellus, Trebonius, Cinna; Publius, Popilius, Artemidorus, the Soothsayer, and other Senators and Petitioners. The ides of March are come. SOOTHSAYER Ay, Caesar, but not gone. ARTEMIDORUS Hail, Caesar. Read this schedule. Trebonius doth desire you to o’erread, At your best leisure, this his humble suit. O Caesar, read mine first, for mine’s a suit That touches Caesar nearer. Read it, great Caesar. What touches us ourself shall be last served. Delay not, Caesar; read it instantly. What, is the fellow mad? Sirrah, give place. What, urge you your petitions in the street? Come to the Capitol. Caesar goes forward, the rest following. to Cassius I wish your enterprise today may thrive. What enterprise, Popilius? Fare you well. He walks away. What said Popilius Lena? He wished today our enterprise might thrive. I fear our purpose is discoverèd. Look how he makes to Caesar. Mark him. Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention.— Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known, Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back, For I will slay myself. Cassius, be constant. Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes, For look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change. Trebonius knows his time, for look you, Brutus, He draws Mark Antony out of the way. Trebonius and Antony exit. Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him go And presently prefer his suit to Caesar. He is addressed. Press near and second him. Casca, you are the first that rears your hand. Are we all ready? What is now amiss That Caesar and his Senate must redress? kneeling Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar, Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat An humble heart. I must prevent thee, Cimber. These couchings and these lowly courtesies Might fire the blood of ordinary men And turn preordinance and first decree Into the law of children. Be not fond To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood That will be thawed from the true quality With that which melteth fools—I mean sweet words, Low-crookèd curtsies, and base spaniel fawning. Thy brother by decree is banishèd. If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him, I spurn thee like a cur out of my way. Know: Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause Will he be satisfied. Is there no voice more worthy than my own To sound more sweetly in great Caesar’s ear For the repealing of my banished brother? kneeling I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar, Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may Have an immediate freedom of repeal. What, Brutus? kneeling Pardon, Caesar; Caesar, pardon! As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber. I could be well moved, if I were as you. If I could pray to move, prayers would move me. But I am constant as the Northern Star, Of whose true fixed and resting quality There is no fellow in the firmament. The skies are painted with unnumbered sparks; They are all fire, and every one doth shine. But there’s but one in all doth hold his place. So in the world: ’tis furnished well with men, And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive. Yet in the number I do know but one That unassailable holds on his rank, Unshaked of motion; and that I am he Let me a little show it, even in this: That I was constant Cimber should be banished And constant do remain to keep him so. kneeling O Caesar— Hence. Wilt thou lift up Olympus? kneeling Great Caesar— Doth not Brutus bootless kneel? Speak, hands, for me! As Casca strikes, the others rise up and stab Caesar. Et tu, Brutè?—Then fall, Caesar. He dies. Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead! Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets. Some to the common pulpits and cry out “Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement.” People and Senators, be not affrighted. Fly not; stand still. Ambition’s debt is paid. Go to the pulpit, Brutus. And Cassius too. Where’s Publius? Here, quite confounded with this mutiny. Stand fast together, lest some friend of Caesar’s Should chance— Talk not of standing.—Publius, good cheer. There is no harm intended to your person, Nor to no Roman else. So tell them, Publius. And leave us, Publius, lest that the people, Rushing on us, should do your age some mischief. Do so, and let no man abide this deed But we the doers. All but the Conspirators exit. Enter Trebonius. Where is Antony? TREBONIUS Fled to his house amazed. Men, wives, and children stare, cry out, and run As it were doomsday. BRUTUS Fates, we will know your pleasures. That we shall die we know; ’tis but the time, And drawing days out, that men stand upon. Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life Cuts off so many years of fearing death. Grant that, and then is death a benefit. So are we Caesar’s friends, that have abridged His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop, And let us bathe our hands in Caesar’s blood Up to the elbows and besmear our swords. Then walk we forth, even to the marketplace, And, waving our red weapons o’er our heads, Let’s all cry “Peace, freedom, and liberty!” Stoop then, and wash. They smear their hands and swords with Caesar’s blood. How many ages hence Shall this our lofty scene be acted over In states unborn and accents yet unknown! How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport, That now on Pompey’s basis lies along No worthier than the dust! So oft as that shall be, So often shall the knot of us be called The men that gave their country liberty. What, shall we forth? Ay, every man away. Brutus shall lead, and we will grace his heels With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome. Enter a Servant. Soft, who comes here? A friend of Antony’s. kneeling Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel. Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down, And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say: Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest; Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving. Say, I love Brutus, and I honor him; Say, I feared Caesar, honored him, and loved him. If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony May safely come to him and be resolved How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death, Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead So well as Brutus living, but will follow The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus Thorough the hazards of this untrod state With all true faith. So says my master Antony. Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman. I never thought him worse. Tell him, so please him come unto this place, He shall be satisfied and, by my honor, Depart untouched. I’ll fetch him presently. Servant exits. I know that we shall have him well to friend. I wish we may; but yet have I a mind That fears him much, and my misgiving still Falls shrewdly to the purpose. Enter Antony. But here comes Antony.—Welcome, Mark Antony! O mighty Caesar, dost thou lie so low? Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.— I know not, gentlemen, what you intend, Who else must be let blood, who else is rank. If I myself, there is no hour so fit As Caesar’s death’s hour, nor no instrument Of half that worth as those your swords made rich With the most noble blood of all this world. I do beseech you, if you bear me hard, Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke, Fulfill your pleasure. Live a thousand years, I shall not find myself so apt to die; No place will please me so, no mean of death, As here by Caesar, and by you cut off, The choice and master spirits of this age. O Antony, beg not your death of us! Though now we must appear bloody and cruel, As by our hands and this our present act You see we do, yet see you but our hands And this the bleeding business they have done. Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful; And pity to the general wrong of Rome (As fire drives out fire, so pity pity) Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part, To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony. Our arms in strength of malice, and our hearts Of brothers’ temper, do receive you in With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence. Your voice shall be as strong as any man’s In the disposing of new dignities. Only be patient till we have appeased The multitude, beside themselves with fear; And then we will deliver you the cause Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him, Have thus proceeded. I doubt not of your wisdom. Let each man render me his bloody hand. First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you.— Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand.— Now, Decius Brutus, yours;—now yours, Metellus;— Yours, Cinna;—and, my valiant Casca, yours;— Though last, not least in love, yours, good Trebonius.— Gentlemen all—alas, what shall I say? My credit now stands on such slippery ground That one of two bad ways you must conceit me, Either a coward or a flatterer.— That I did love thee, Caesar, O, ’tis true! If then thy spirit look upon us now, Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death To see thy Antony making his peace, Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes— Most noble!—in the presence of thy corpse? Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds, Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood, It would become me better than to close In terms of friendship with thine enemies. Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bayed, brave hart, Here didst thou fall, and here thy hunters stand Signed in thy spoil and crimsoned in thy Lethe. O world, thou wast the forest to this hart, And this indeed, O world, the heart of thee. How like a deer strucken by many princes Dost thou here lie! Mark Antony— Pardon me, Caius Cassius. The enemies of Caesar shall say this; Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty. I blame you not for praising Caesar so. But what compact mean you to have with us? Will you be pricked in number of our friends, Or shall we on and not depend on you? Therefore I took your hands, but was indeed Swayed from the point by looking down on Caesar. Friends am I with you all and love you all, Upon this hope, that you shall give me reasons Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous. Or else were this a savage spectacle. Our reasons are so full of good regard That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar, You should be satisfied. That’s all I seek; And am, moreover, suitor that I may Produce his body to the marketplace, And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend, Speak in the order of his funeral. You shall, Mark Antony. Brutus, a word with you. Aside to Brutus. You know not what you do. Do not consent That Antony speak in his funeral. Know you how much the people may be moved By that which he will utter? aside to Cassius By your pardon, I will myself into the pulpit first And show the reason of our Caesar’s death. What Antony shall speak I will protest He speaks by leave and by permission, And that we are contented Caesar shall Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies. It shall advantage more than do us wrong. aside to Brutus I know not what may fall. I like it not. Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar’s body. You shall not in your funeral speech blame us But speak all good you can devise of Caesar And say you do ’t by our permission, Else shall you not have any hand at all About his funeral. And you shall speak In the same pulpit whereto I am going, After my speech is ended. Be it so. I do desire no more. Prepare the body, then, and follow us. All but Antony exit. O pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth, That I am meek and gentle with these butchers. Thou art the ruins of the noblest man That ever livèd in the tide of times. Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood! Over thy wounds now do I prophesy (Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue) A curse shall light upon the limbs of men; Domestic fury and fierce civil strife Shall cumber all the parts of Italy; Blood and destruction shall be so in use And dreadful objects so familiar That mothers shall but smile when they behold Their infants quartered with the hands of war, All pity choked with custom of fell deeds; And Caesar’s spirit, ranging for revenge, With Ate by his side come hot from hell, Shall in these confines with a monarch’s voice Cry “Havoc!” and let slip the dogs of war, That this foul deed shall smell above the earth With carrion men groaning for burial. Enter Octavius’ Servant. You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not? do, Mark Antony. Caesar did write for him to come to Rome. He did receive his letters and is coming, And bid me say to you by word of mouth— O Caesar! Thy heart is big. Get thee apart and weep. Passion, I see, is catching, for mine eyes, Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine, Began to water. Is thy master coming? He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome. Post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced. Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome, No Rome of safety for Octavius yet. Hie hence and tell him so.—Yet stay awhile; Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corpse Into the marketplace. There shall I try, In my oration, how the people take The cruel issue of these bloody men, According to the which thou shalt discourse To young Octavius of the state of things. Lend me your hand. They exit with Caesar’s body.",
      "The scene reveals the ruthless pragmatism of Antony and Octavius as they consolidate power, demonstrated by their cold-blooded execution of enemies and willingness to sacrifice even family. Antony's dismissive attitude towards Lepidus, viewing him as a mere tool, highlights the power dynamics within the triumvirate and foreshadows future conflict. The political tension escalates as they acknowledge the growing threat posed by Brutus and Cassius, prompting them to strategize and solidify their alliance. This scene establishes a cause-effect relationship: the assassination of Caesar leads to a brutal power struggle and the formation of opposing factions preparing for war.",
      "Brutus grapples with the moral implications of assassinating Caesar, acknowledging no personal animosity but fearing Caesar's potential for tyranny if crowned. The arrival of the letter and the conspirators intensifies his internal conflict, pushing him toward action despite his reservations. Brutus's struggle is further complicated by Portia's plea for his trust, highlighting the tension between his public duty and private life. Finally, Ligarius's arrival and immediate willingness to follow Brutus underscores Brutus's influence and the momentum of the conspiracy, setting the stage for the assassination.",

    "contexts": [
      "Enter Brutus and Cassius with the Plebeians. We will be satisfied! Let us be satisfied! Then follow me and give me audience, friends.— Cassius, go you into the other street And part the numbers.— Those that will hear me speak, let ’em stay here; Those that will follow Cassius, go with him; And public reasons shall be renderèd Of Caesar’s death. I will hear Brutus speak. I will hear Cassius, and compare their reasons When severally we hear them renderèd. Cassius exits with some of the Plebeians. Brutus goes into the pulpit. The noble Brutus is ascended. Silence. Be patient till the last. Romans, countrymen, and lovers, hear me for my cause, and be silent that you may hear. Believe me for mine honor, and have respect to mine honor that you may believe. Censure me in your wisdom, and awake your senses that you may the better judge. If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of Caesar’s, to him I say that Brutus’ love to Caesar was no less than his. If then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer: not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living, and die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live all freemen? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him. As he was fortunate, I rejoice at it. As he was valiant, I honor him. But, as he was ambitious, I slew him. There is tears for his love, joy for his fortune, honor for his valor, and death for his ambition. Who is here so base that would be a bondman? If any, speak, for him have I offended. Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If any, speak, for him have I offended. Who is here so vile that will not love his country? If any, speak, for him have I offended. I pause for a reply. None, Brutus, none. Then none have I offended. I have done no more to Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question of his death is enrolled in the Capitol, his glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy, nor his offenses enforced for which he suffered death. Enter Mark Antony and others with Caesar’s body. Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony, who, though he had no hand in his death, shall receive the benefit of his dying—a place in the commonwealth—as which of you shall not? With this I depart: that, as I slew my best lover for the good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself when it shall please my country to need my death. Live, Brutus, live, live! Bring him with triumph home unto his house. Give him a statue with his ancestors. Let him be Caesar. Caesar’s better parts Shall be crowned in Brutus. We’ll bring him to his house with shouts and clamors. My countrymen— Peace, silence! Brutus speaks. Peace, ho! Good countrymen, let me depart alone, And, for my sake, stay here with Antony. Do grace to Caesar’s corpse, and grace his speech Tending to Caesar’s glories, which Mark Antony (By our permission) is allowed to make. I do entreat you, not a man depart, Save I alone, till Antony have spoke. He descends and exits. Stay, ho, and let us hear Mark Antony! Let him go up into the public chair. We’ll hear him.—Noble Antony, go up. For Brutus’ sake, I am beholding to you. He goes into the pulpit. What does he say of Brutus? He says for Brutus’ sake He finds himself beholding to us all. ’Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here. This Caesar was a tyrant. Nay, that’s certain. We are blest that Rome is rid of him. Peace, let us hear what Antony can say. You gentle Romans— Peace, ho! Let us hear him. Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears. I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him. The evil that men do lives after them; The good is oft interrèd with their bones. So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus Hath told you Caesar was ambitious. If it were so, it was a grievous fault, And grievously hath Caesar answered it. Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest (For Brutus is an honorable man; So are they all, all honorable men), Come I to speak in Caesar’s funeral. He was my friend, faithful and just to me, But Brutus says he was ambitious, And Brutus is an honorable man. He hath brought many captives home to Rome, Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill. Did this in Caesar seem ambitious? When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept; Ambition should be made of sterner stuff. Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, And Brutus is an honorable man. You all did see that on the Lupercal I thrice presented him a kingly crown, Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, And sure he is an honorable man. I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, But here I am to speak what I do know. You all did love him once, not without cause. What cause withholds you, then, to mourn for him?— O judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar, And I must pause till it come back to me. He weeps. Methinks there is much reason in his sayings. If thou consider rightly of the matter, Caesar has had great wrong. Has he, masters? I fear there will a worse come in his place. Marked you his words? He would not take the crown; Therefore ’tis certain he was not ambitious. If it be found so, some will dear abide it. Poor soul, his eyes are red as fire with weeping. There’s not a nobler man in Rome than Antony. Now mark him. He begins again to speak. But yesterday the word of Caesar might Have stood against the world. Now lies he there, And none so poor to do him reverence. O masters, if I were disposed to stir Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage, I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong, Who, you all know, are honorable men. I will not do them wrong. I rather choose To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you, Than I will wrong such honorable men. But here’s a parchment with the seal of Caesar. I found it in his closet. ’Tis his will. Let but the commons hear this testament, Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read, And they would go and kiss dead Caesar’s wounds And dip their napkins in his sacred blood— Yea, beg a hair of him for memory And, dying, mention it within their wills, Bequeathing it as a rich legacy Unto their issue. We’ll hear the will. Read it, Mark Antony. The will, the will! We will hear Caesar’s will. Have patience, gentle friends. I must not read it. It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you. You are not wood, you are not stones, but men. And, being men, hearing the will of Caesar, It will inflame you; it will make you mad. ’Tis good you know not that you are his heirs, For if you should, O, what would come of it? Read the will! We’ll hear it, Antony. You shall read us the will, Caesar’s will. Will you be patient? Will you stay awhile? I have o’ershot myself to tell you of it. I fear I wrong the honorable men Whose daggers have stabbed Caesar. I do fear it. They were traitors. Honorable men? The will! The testament! They were villains, murderers. The will! Read the will. You will compel me, then, to read the will? Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar, And let me show you him that made the will. Shall I descend? And will you give me leave? Come down. Descend. You shall have leave. Antony descends. A ring; stand round. Stand from the hearse. Stand from the body. Room for Antony, most noble Antony. Nay, press not so upon me. Stand far off. Stand back! Room! Bear back! If you have tears, prepare to shed them now. You all do know this mantle. I remember The first time ever Caesar put it on. ’Twas on a summer’s evening in his tent, That day he overcame the Nervii. Look, in this place ran Cassius’ dagger through. See what a rent the envious Casca made. Through this the well-belovèd Brutus stabbed, And, as he plucked his cursèd steel away, Mark how the blood of Caesar followed it, As rushing out of doors to be resolved If Brutus so unkindly knocked or no; For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar’s angel. Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him! This was the most unkindest cut of all. For when the noble Caesar saw him stab, Ingratitude, more strong than traitors’ arms, Quite vanquished him. Then burst his mighty heart, And, in his mantle muffling up his face, Even at the base of Pompey’s statue (Which all the while ran blood) great Caesar fell. what a fall was there, my countrymen! Then I and you and all of us fell down, Whilst bloody treason flourished over us. now you weep, and I perceive you feel The dint of pity. These are gracious drops. Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold Our Caesar’s vesture wounded? Look you here, Antony lifts Caesar’s cloak. Here is himself, marred as you see with traitors. O piteous spectacle! O noble Caesar! O woeful day! O traitors, villains! O most bloody sight! We will be revenged. Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill! Slay! Let not a traitor live! Stay, countrymen. Peace there! Hear the noble Antony. We’ll hear him, we’ll follow him, we’ll die with him. Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up To such a sudden flood of mutiny. They that have done this deed are honorable. What private griefs they have, alas, I know not, That made them do it. They are wise and honorable And will no doubt with reasons answer you. I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts. I am no orator, as Brutus is, But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man That love my friend, and that they know full well That gave me public leave to speak of him. For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth, Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech To stir men’s blood. I only speak right on. I tell you that which you yourselves do know, Show you sweet Caesar’s wounds, poor poor dumb mouths, And bid them speak for me. But were I Brutus, And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue In every wound of Caesar that should move The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny. We’ll mutiny. We’ll burn the house of Brutus. Away then. Come, seek the conspirators. Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak. Peace, ho! Hear Antony, most noble Antony! Why, friends, you go to do you know not what. Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves? Alas, you know not. I must tell you then. You have forgot the will I told you of. Most true. The will! Let’s stay and hear the will. Here is the will, and under Caesar’s seal: To every Roman citizen he gives, To every several man, seventy-five drachmas. Most noble Caesar! We’ll revenge his death. O royal Caesar! Hear me with patience. Peace, ho! Moreover, he hath left you all his walks, His private arbors, and new-planted orchards, On this side Tiber. He hath left them you, And to your heirs forever—common pleasures To walk abroad and recreate yourselves. Here was a Caesar! When comes such another? Never, never!—Come, away, away! We’ll burn his body in the holy place And with the brands fire the traitors’ houses. Take up the body. Go fetch fire. Pluck down benches. Pluck down forms, windows, anything.

He and Lepidus are at Caesar’s house. And thither will I straight to visit him. He comes upon a wish. Fortune is merry And in this mood will give us anything.

      "Enter Caesar, Antony for the course, Calphurnia, Portia, Decius, Cicero, Brutus, Cassius, Casca, a Soothsayer; after them Marullus and Flavius and Commoners. Calphurnia. Peace, ho! Caesar speaks. Calphurnia. Here, my lord. Stand you directly in Antonius’ way When he doth run his course.—Antonius. Caesar, my lord. Forget not in your speed, Antonius, To touch Calphurnia, for our elders say The barren, touchèd in this holy chase, Shake off their sterile curse. I shall remember. When Caesar says “Do this,” it is performed. Set on and leave no ceremony out. Sennet. Caesar. Ha! Who calls? Bid every noise be still. Peace, yet again! Who is it in the press that calls on me? I hear a tongue shriller than all the music Cry “Caesar.” Speak. Caesar is turned to hear. Beware the ides of March. What man is that? A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March. Set him before me. Let me see his face. Fellow, come from the throng. The Soothsayer comes forward. Look upon Caesar. What sayst thou to me now? Speak once again. Beware the ides of March. He is a dreamer. Let us leave him. Pass. Sennet. All but Brutus and Cassius exit. Will you go see the order of the course? Not I. I pray you, do. I am not gamesome. I do lack some part Of that quick spirit that is in Antony. Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires. I’ll leave you. Brutus, I do observe you now of late. I have not from your eyes that gentleness And show of love as I was wont to have. You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand Over your friend that loves you. Cassius, Be not deceived. If I have veiled my look, I turn the trouble of my countenance Merely upon myself. Vexèd I am Of late with passions of some difference, Conceptions only proper to myself, Which give some soil, perhaps, to my behaviors. But let not therefore my good friends be grieved (Among which number, Cassius, be you one) Nor construe any further my neglect Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war, Forgets the shows of love to other men. Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion, By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations. Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face? No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself But by reflection, by some other things. ’Tis just. And it is very much lamented, Brutus, That you have no such mirrors as will turn Your hidden worthiness into your eye, That you might see your shadow. I have heard Where many of the best respect in Rome, Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus And groaning underneath this age’s yoke, Have wished that noble Brutus had his eyes. Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius, That you would have me seek into myself For that which is not in me? Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear. And since you know you cannot see yourself So well as by reflection, I, your glass, Will modestly discover to yourself That of yourself which you yet know not of. And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus. Were I a common laughter, or did use To stale with ordinary oaths my love To every new protester; if you know That I do fawn on men and hug them hard And after scandal them, or if you know That I profess myself in banqueting To all the rout, then hold me dangerous. Flourish and shout. What means this shouting? I do fear the people Choose Caesar for their king. Ay, do you fear it? Then must I think you would not have it so. I would not, Cassius, yet I love him well. But wherefore do you hold me here so long? What is it that you would impart to me? If it be aught toward the general good, Set honor in one eye and death i’ th’ other And I will look on both indifferently; For let the gods so speed me as I love The name of honor more than I fear death. I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus, As well as I do know your outward favor. Well, honor is the subject of my story. I cannot tell what you and other men Think of this life; but, for my single self, I had as lief not be as live to be In awe of such a thing as I myself. I was born free as Caesar; so were you; We both have fed as well, and we can both Endure the winter’s cold as well as he. For once, upon a raw and gusty day, The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores, Caesar said to me “Dar’st thou, Cassius, now Leap in with me into this angry flood And swim to yonder point?” Upon the word, Accoutered as I was, I plungèd in And bade him follow; so indeed he did. The torrent roared, and we did buffet it With lusty sinews, throwing it aside And stemming it with hearts of controversy. But ere we could arrive the point proposed, Caesar cried “Help me, Cassius, or I sink!” as Aeneas, our great ancestor, Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber Did I the tired Caesar. And this man Is now become a god, and Cassius is A wretched creature and must bend his body If Caesar carelessly but nod on him. He had a fever when he was in Spain, And when the fit was on him, I did mark How he did shake. ’Tis true, this god did shake. His coward lips did from their color fly, And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world Did lose his luster. I did hear him groan. Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans Mark him and write his speeches in their books, “Alas,” it cried “Give me some drink, Titinius” As a sick girl. You gods, it doth amaze me A man of such a feeble temper should So get the start of the majestic world And bear the palm alone. Shout. Flourish. Another general shout! I do believe that these applauses are For some new honors that are heaped on Caesar. Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world Like a Colossus, and we petty men Walk under his huge legs and peep about To find ourselves dishonorable graves. Men at some time are masters of their fates. The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, But in ourselves, that we are underlings. “Brutus” and “Caesar”—what should be in that “Caesar”? Why should that name be sounded more than yours? Write them together, yours is as fair a name; Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well; Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with ’em, “Brutus” will start a spirit as soon as “Caesar.” Now, in the names of all the gods at once, Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed! Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods! When went there by an age, since the great flood, But it was famed with more than with one man? When could they say, till now, that talked of Rome, That her wide walks encompassed but one man? Now is it Rome indeed, and room enough When there is in it but one only man. you and I have heard our fathers say There was a Brutus once that would have brooked Th’ eternal devil to keep his state in Rome As easily as a king. That you do love me, I am nothing jealous. What you would work me to, I have some aim. How I have thought of this, and of these times, I shall recount hereafter. For this present, I would not, so with love I might entreat you, Be any further moved. What you have said I will consider; what you have to say I will with patience hear, and find a time Both meet to hear and answer such high things. Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this: Brutus had rather be a villager Than to repute himself a son of Rome Under these hard conditions as this time Is like to lay upon us. I am glad that my weak words Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus. Enter Caesar and his train. The games are done, and Caesar is returning. As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve, And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you What hath proceeded worthy note today. I will do so. But look you, Cassius, The angry spot doth glow on Caesar’s brow, And all the rest look like a chidden train. Calphurnia’s cheek is pale, and Cicero Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes As we have seen him in the Capitol, Being crossed in conference by some senators. Casca will tell us what the matter is. Antonius. Caesar. Let me have men about me that are fat, Sleek-headed men, and such as sleep a-nights. Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look. He thinks too much. Such men are dangerous. Fear him not, Caesar; he’s not dangerous. He is a noble Roman, and well given. Would he were fatter! But I fear him not. Yet if my name were liable to fear, I do not know the man I should avoid So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much, He is a great observer, and he looks Quite through the deeds of men. He loves no plays, As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music; Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort As if he mocked himself and scorned his spirit That could be moved to smile at anything. Such men as he be never at heart’s ease Whiles they behold a greater than themselves, And therefore are they very dangerous. I rather tell thee what is to be feared Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar. Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf, And tell me truly what thou think’st of him. Sennet. Caesar and his train exit but Casca remains behind. You pulled me by the cloak. Would you speak with me? Ay, Casca. Tell us what hath chanced today That Caesar looks so sad. Why, you were with him, were you not? I should not then ask Casca what had chanced. Why, there was a crown offered him; and, being offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand, thus, and then the people fell a-shouting. What was the second noise for? Why, for that too. They shouted thrice. What was the last cry for? Why, for that too. Was the crown offered him thrice? Ay, marry, was ’t, and he put it by thrice, every time gentler than other; and at every putting-by, mine honest neighbors shouted. Who offered him the crown? Why, Antony. Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca. I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it. It was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown (yet ’twas not a crown neither; ’twas one of these coronets), and, as I told you, he put it by once; but for all that, to my thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he offered it to him again; then he put it by again; but to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it. And then he offered it the third time. He put it the third time by, and still as he refused it the rabblement hooted and clapped their chopped hands and threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked Caesar, for he swooned and fell down at it. And for mine own part, I durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air. But soft, I pray you. What, did Caesar swoon? He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and was speechless. ’Tis very like; he hath the falling sickness. No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness. I know not what you mean by that, but I am sure Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and displeased them, as they use to do the players in the theater, I am no true man. What said he when he came unto himself? Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common herd was glad he refused the crown, he plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his throat to cut. An I had been a man of any occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word, I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so he fell. When he came to himself again, he said if he had done or said anything amiss, he desired their Worships to think it was his infirmity. Three or four wenches where I stood cried “Alas, good soul!” and forgave him with all their hearts. But there’s no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less. And, after that, he came thus sad away? Ay. Did Cicero say anything? Ay, he spoke Greek. To what effect? Nay, an I tell you that, I’ll ne’er look you i’ th’ face again. But those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads. But for mine own part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarves off Caesar’s images, are put to silence. Fare you well. There was more foolery yet, if I could remember it. Will you sup with me tonight, Casca? No, I am promised forth. Will you dine with me tomorrow? Ay, if I be alive, and your mind hold, and your dinner worth the eating. Good. I will expect you. Do so. Farewell both. He exits. What a blunt fellow is this grown to be! He was quick mettle when he went to school. So is he now in execution Of any bold or noble enterprise, However he puts on this tardy form. This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit, Which gives men stomach to digest his words With better appetite. And so it is. For this time I will leave you. Tomorrow, if you please to speak with me, I will come home to you; or, if you will, Come home to me, and I will wait for you. I will do so. Till then, think of the world. Brutus exits. Well, Brutus, thou art noble. Yet I see Thy honorable mettle may be wrought From that it is disposed. Therefore it is meet That noble minds keep ever with their likes; For who so firm that cannot be seduced? Caesar doth bear me hard, but he loves Brutus. If I were Brutus now, and he were Cassius, He should not humor me. I will this night In several hands in at his windows throw, As if they came from several citizens, Writings, all tending to the great opinion That Rome holds of his name, wherein obscurely Caesar’s ambition shall be glancèd at And after this, let Caesar seat him sure, For we will shake him, or worse days endure. He exits.",

Antony's calculated use of rhetoric, feigning reluctance while skillfully revealing Caesar's will and displaying his wounds, incites the plebeians to seek revenge, demonstrating the power of emotional appeals over rational arguments in swaying public opinion.

Here comes the General.— Brutus is ta’en, Brutus is ta’en, my lord. Where is he? Safe, Antony, Brutus is safe enough. I dare assure thee that no enemy Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus. The gods defend him from so great a shame! When you do find him, or alive or dead, He will be found like Brutus, like himself. This is not Brutus, friend, but I assure you, A prize no less in worth.

Then follow me and give me audience, friends.— Cassius, go you into the other street And part the numbers.— Those that will hear me speak, let ’em stay here; Those that will follow Cassius, go with him; And public reasons shall be renderèd Of Caesar’s death. I will hear Brutus speak. I will hear Cassius, and compare their reasons When severally we hear them renderèd. Cassius exits with some of the Plebeians. Brutus goes into the pulpit. The noble Brutus is ascended. Silence. Be patient till the last. Romans, countrymen, and lovers, hear me for my cause, and be silent that you may hear. Believe me for mine honor, and have respect to mine honor that you may believe. Censure me in your wisdom, and awake your senses that you may the better judge. If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of Caesar’s, to him I say that Brutus’ love to Caesar was no less than his. If then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer: not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living, and die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live all freemen? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him. As he was fortunate, I rejoice at it. As he was valiant, I honor him. But, as he was ambitious, I slew him. There is tears for his love, joy for his fortune, honor for his valor, and death for his ambition. Who is here so base that would be a bondman? If any, speak, for him have I offended. Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If any, speak, for him have I offended. Who is here so vile that will not love his country? If any, speak, for him have I offended. I pause for a reply. None, Brutus, none. Then none have I offended. I have done no more to Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question of his death is enrolled in the Capitol, his glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy, nor his offenses enforced for which he suffered death. Enter Mark Antony and others with Caesar’s body. Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony, who, though he had no hand in his death, shall receive the benefit of his dying—a place in the commonwealth—as which of you shall not? With this I depart: that, as I slew my best lover for the good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself when it shall please my country to need my death. Live, Brutus, live, live! Bring him with triumph home unto his house. Give him a statue with his ancestors. Let him be Caesar. Caesar’s better parts Shall be crowned in Brutus. We’ll bring him to his house with shouts and clamors. My countrymen— Peace, silence! Brutus speaks. Peace, ho! Good countrymen, let me depart alone, And, for my sake, stay here with Antony. Do grace to Caesar’s corpse, and grace his speech Tending to Caesar’s glories, which Mark Antony (By our permission) is allowed to make. I do entreat you, not a man depart, Save I alone, till Antony have spoke. He descends and exits. Stay, ho, and let us hear Mark Antony! Let him go up into the public chair. We’ll hear him.—Noble Antony, go up. For Brutus’ sake, I am beholding to you. He goes into the pulpit. What does he say of Brutus? He says for Brutus’ sake He finds himself beholding to us all. ’Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here. This Caesar was a tyrant. Nay, that’s certain. We are blest that Rome is rid of him. Peace, let us hear what Antony can say. You gentle Romans— Peace, ho! Let us hear him. Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears. I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him. The evil that men do lives after them; The good is oft interrèd with their bones. So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus Hath told you Caesar was ambitious. If it were so, it was a grievous fault, And grievously hath Caesar answered it. Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest (For Brutus is an honorable man; So are they all, all honorable men), Come I to speak in Caesar’s funeral. He was my friend, faithful and just to me, But Brutus says he was ambitious, And Brutus is an honorable man. He hath brought many captives home to Rome, Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill. Did this in Caesar seem ambitious? When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept; Ambition should be made of sterner stuff. Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, And Brutus is an honorable man. You all did see that on the Lupercal I thrice presented him a kingly crown, Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, And sure he is an honorable man. I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, But here I am to speak what I do know. You all did love him once, not without cause. What cause withholds you, then, to mourn for him?— O judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar, And I must pause till it come back to me. He weeps. Methinks there is much reason in his sayings. If thou consider rightly of the matter, Caesar has had great wrong. Has he, masters? I fear there will a worse come in his place. Marked you his words? He would not take the crown; Therefore ’tis certain he was not ambitious. If it be found so, some will dear abide it. Poor soul, his eyes are red as fire with weeping. There’s not a nobler man in Rome than Antony. Now mark him. He begins again to speak. But yesterday the word of Caesar might Have stood against the world. Now lies he there, And none so poor to do him reverence. O masters, if I were disposed to stir Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage, I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong, Who, you all know, are honorable men. I will not do them wrong. I rather choose To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you, Than I will wrong such honorable men. But here’s a parchment with the seal of Caesar. I found it in his closet. ’Tis his will. Let but the commons hear this testament, Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read, And they would go and kiss dead Caesar’s wounds And dip their napkins in his sacred blood— Yea, beg a hair of him for memory And, dying, mention it within their wills, Bequeathing it as a rich legacy Unto their issue. We’ll hear the will. Read it, Mark Antony. The will, the will! We will hear Caesar’s will. Have patience, gentle friends. I must not read it. It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you. You are not wood, you are not stones, but men. And, being men, hearing the will of Caesar, It will inflame you; it will make you mad. ’Tis good you know not that you are his heirs, For if you should, O, what would come of it? Read the will! We’ll hear it, Antony. You shall read us the will, Caesar’s will. Will you be patient? Will you stay awhile? I have o’ershot myself to tell you of it. I fear I wrong the honorable men Whose daggers have stabbed Caesar. I do fear it. They were traitors. Honorable men? The will! The testament! They were villains, murderers. The will! Read the will. You will compel me, then, to read the will? Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar, And let me show you him that made the will. Shall I descend? And will you give me leave? Come down. Descend. You shall have leave. Antony descends. A ring; stand round. Stand from the hearse. Stand from the body. Room for Antony, most noble Antony. Nay, press not so upon me. Stand far off. Stand back! Room! Bear back! If you have tears, prepare to shed them now. You all do know this mantle. I remember The first time ever Caesar put it on. ’Twas on a summer’s evening in his tent, That day he overcame the Nervii. Look, in this place ran Cassius’ dagger through. See what a rent the envious Casca made. Through this the well-belovèd Brutus stabbed, And, as he plucked his cursèd steel away, Mark how the blood of Caesar followed it, As rushing out of doors to be resolved If Brutus so unkindly knocked or no; For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar’s angel. Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him! This was the most unkindest cut of all. For when the noble Caesar saw him stab, Ingratitude, more strong than traitors’ arms, Quite vanquished him. Then burst his mighty heart, And, in his mantle muffling up his face, Even at the base of Pompey’s statue (Which all the while ran blood) great Caesar fell. what a fall was there, my countrymen! Then I and you and all of us fell down, Whilst bloody treason flourished over us. now you weep, and I perceive you feel The dint of pity. These are gracious drops. Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold Our Caesar’s vesture wounded? Look you here, Antony lifts Caesar’s cloak. Here is himself, marred as you see with traitors. O piteous spectacle! O noble Caesar! O woeful day! O traitors, villains! O most bloody sight! We will be revenged. Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill! Slay! Let not a traitor live! Stay, countrymen. Peace there! Hear the noble Antony. We’ll hear him, we’ll follow him, we’ll die with him. Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up To such a sudden flood of mutiny. They that have done this deed are honorable. What private griefs they have, alas, I know not, That made them do it. They are wise and honorable And will no doubt with reasons answer you. I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts. I am no orator, as Brutus is, But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man That love my friend, and that they know full well That gave me public leave to speak of him. For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth, Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech To stir men’s blood. I only speak right on. I tell you that which you yourselves do know, Show you sweet Caesar’s wounds, poor poor dumb mouths, And bid them speak for me. But were I Brutus, And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue In every wound of Caesar that should move The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny. We’ll mutiny. We’ll burn the house of Brutus. Away then. Come, seek the conspirators. Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak. Peace, ho! Hear Antony, most noble Antony! Why, friends, you go to do you know not what. Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves? Alas, you know not. I must tell you then. You have forgot the will I told you of. Most true. The will! Let’s stay and hear the will. Here is the will, and under Caesar’s seal: To every Roman citizen he gives, To every several man, seventy-five drachmas. Most noble Caesar! We’ll revenge his death. O royal Caesar! Hear me with patience. Peace, ho! Moreover, he hath left you all his walks, His private arbors, and new-planted orchards, On this side Tiber. He hath left them you, And to your heirs forever—common pleasures To walk abroad and recreate yourselves. Here was a Caesar! When comes such another? Never, never!—Come, away, away! We’ll burn his body in the holy place And with the brands fire the traitors’ houses. Take up the body. Go fetch fire. Pluck down benches. Pluck down forms, windows, anything. Plebeians exit with Caesar’s body. Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot; Take thou what course thou wilt. Enter Servant. How now, fellow? Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome. Where is he? He and Lepidus are at Caesar’s house. And thither will I straight to visit him. He comes upon a wish. Fortune is merry And in this mood will give us anything. I heard him say Brutus and Cassius Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome. Belike they had some notice of the people How I had moved them. Bring me to Octavius. They exit.",

It proves not so; their battles are at hand. They mean to warn us at Philippi here, Answering before we do demand of them. Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know Wherefore they do it. They could be content To visit other places, and come down With fearful bravery, thinking by this face To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage. But ’tis not so. Enter a Messenger. Prepare you, generals. The enemy comes on in gallant show. Their bloody sign of battle is hung out, And something to be done immediately. Octavius, lead your battle softly on Upon the left hand of the even field. Upon the right hand, I; keep thou the left. Why do you cross me in this exigent? I do not cross you, but I will do so. March. Drum. Enter Brutus, Cassius, and their army including Lucilius, Titinius, and Messala. They stand and would have parley. Stand fast, Titinius. We must out and talk. Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle? No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge. Make forth. The Generals would have some words. to his Officers Stir not until the signal. The Generals step forward. Words before blows; is it so, countrymen? Not that we love words better, as you do. Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius. In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words. Witness the hole you made in Caesar’s heart, Crying “Long live, hail, Caesar!” Antony, The posture of your blows are yet unknown, But, for your words, they rob the Hybla bees And leave them honeyless. Not stingless too. O yes, and soundless too, For you have stolen their buzzing, Antony, And very wisely threat before you sting. Villains, you did not so when your vile daggers Hacked one another in the sides of Caesar. You showed your teeth like apes and fawned like hounds And bowed like bondmen, kissing Caesar’s feet, Whilst damnèd Casca, like a cur, behind Struck Caesar on the neck. O you flatterers! Flatterers?—Now, Brutus, thank yourself! This tongue had not offended so today If Cassius might have ruled. Come, come, the cause. If arguing make us sweat, The proof of it will turn to redder drops. Look, I draw a sword against conspirators; He draws. When think you that the sword goes up again? Never, till Caesar’s three and thirty wounds Be well avenged, or till another Caesar Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors. Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors’ hands Unless thou bring’st them with thee. So I hope. I was not born to die on Brutus’ sword. if thou wert the noblest of thy strain, Young man, thou couldst not die more honorable. A peevish schoolboy, worthless of such honor, Joined with a masker and a reveler! Old Cassius still. Come, Antony, away!— Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth. If you dare fight today, come to the field; If not, when you have stomachs. Octavius, Antony, and their army exit. Why now, blow wind, swell billow, and swim bark! The storm is up, and all is on the hazard. Ho, Lucilius, hark, a word with you. Lucilius and Messala stand forth. My lord? Brutus and Lucilius step aside together. Messala. What says my general? Messala, This is my birthday, as this very day Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala. Be thou my witness that against my will (As Pompey was) am I compelled to set Upon one battle all our liberties. You know that I held Epicurus strong And his opinion. Now I change my mind And partly credit things that do presage. Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perched, Gorging and feeding from our soldiers’ hands, Who to Philippi here consorted us. This morning are they fled away and gone, And in their steads do ravens, crows, and kites Fly o’er our heads and downward look on us As we were sickly prey. Their shadows seem A canopy most fatal, under which Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost. Believe not so. I but believe it partly, For I am fresh of spirit and resolved To meet all perils very constantly. Even so, Lucilius. Brutus returns to Cassius. Now, most noble Brutus, The gods today stand friendly that we may, Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age. But since the affairs of men rests still incertain, Let’s reason with the worst that may befall. If we do lose this battle, then is this The very last time we shall speak together. What are you then determinèd to do? Even by the rule of that philosophy By which I did blame Cato for the death Which he did give himself (I know not how, But I do find it cowardly and vile, For fear of what might fall, so to prevent The time of life), arming myself with patience To stay the providence of some high powers That govern us below. Then, if we lose this battle, You are contented to be led in triumph Thorough the streets of Rome? No, Cassius, no. Think not, thou noble Roman, That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome. He bears too great a mind. But this same day Must end that work the ides of March begun. And whether we shall meet again, I know not. Therefore our everlasting farewell take. Forever and forever farewell, Cassius. If we do meet again, why we shall smile; If not, why then this parting was well made. Forever and forever farewell, Brutus. If we do meet again, we’ll smile indeed; If not, ’tis true this parting was well made. Why then, lead on.—O, that a man might know The end of this day’s business ere it come! But it sufficeth that the day will end, And then the end is known.—Come ho, away! They exit.",

Upon condition Publius shall not live, Who is your sister’s son, Mark Antony. He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn him. But, Lepidus, go you to Caesar’s house; Fetch the will hither, and we shall determine How to cut off some charge in legacies. What, shall I find you here? Or here, or at the Capitol. Lepidus exits. This is a slight, unmeritable man, Meet to be sent on errands. Is it fit, The threefold world divided, he should stand One of the three to share it? So you thought him And took his voice who should be pricked to die In our black sentence and proscription. Octavius, I have seen more days than you, And, though we lay these honors on this man To ease ourselves of diverse sland’rous loads, He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold, To groan and sweat under the business, Either led or driven, as we point the way; And having brought our treasure where we will, Then take we down his load and turn him off (Like to the empty ass) to shake his ears And graze in commons. You may do your will, But he’s a tried and valiant soldier. So is my horse, Octavius, and for that I do appoint him store of provender. It is a creature that I teach to fight, To wind, to stop, to run directly on, His corporal motion governed by my spirit; And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so. He must be taught and trained and bid go forth— A barren-spirited fellow, one that feeds On objects, arts, and imitations Which, out of use and staled by other men, Begin his fashion. Do not talk of him But as a property. And now, Octavius, Listen great things. Brutus and Cassius Are levying powers. We must straight make head. Therefore let our alliance be combined, Our best friends made, our means stretched; And let us presently go sit in council How covert matters may be best disclosed And open perils surest answerèd. Let us do so, for we are at the stake And bayed about with many enemies, And some that smile have in their hearts, I fear, Millions of mischiefs. They exit.",
      "Brutus attempts to justify Caesar's assassination by appealing to the plebeians' patriotism and fear of tyranny, prioritizing the good of Rome over personal loyalty. His appeal to reason and honor, however, is undermined by Antony's emotional manipulation, which stirs the crowd to mutiny by highlighting Caesar's virtues and their personal loss. Antony's calculated use of rhetoric, feigning reluctance while skillfully revealing Caesar's will and displaying his wounds, incites the plebeians to seek revenge, demonstrating the power of emotional appeals over rational arguments in swaying public opinion. The scene culminates in the complete reversal of public sentiment, setting the stage for further conflict and chaos as Antony seizes the opportunity to consolidate power.",
      "The scene reveals the ruthless pragmatism of Antony and Octavius as they consolidate power, demonstrated by their cold-blooded execution of enemies and willingness to sacrifice even family. Antony's dismissive attitude towards Lepidus, viewing him as a mere tool, highlights the power dynamics within the triumvirate and foreshadows future conflict. The political tension escalates as they acknowledge the growing threat posed by Brutus and Cassius, prompting them to strategize and solidify their alliance. This scene establishes a cause-effect relationship: the assassination of Caesar leads to a brutal power struggle and the formation of opposing factions preparing for war.",

I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown (yet ’twas not a crown neither; ’twas one of these coronets), and, as I told you, he put it by once; but for all that, to my thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he offered it to him again; then he put it by again; but to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it. And then he offered it the third time. He put it the third time by, and still as he refused it the rabblement hooted and clapped their chopped hands and threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked Caesar, for he swooned and fell down at it. And for mine own part, I durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air. But soft, I pray you. What, did Caesar swoon?

If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of Caesar’s, to him I say that Brutus’ love to Caesar was no less than his. If then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer: not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living, and die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live all freemen? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him. As he was fortunate, I rejoice at it. As he was valiant, I honor him. But, as he was ambitious, I slew him. There is tears for his love, joy for his fortune, honor for his valor, and death for his ambition. Who is here so base that would be a bondman? If any, speak, for him have I offended. Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If any, speak, for him have I offended. Who is here so vile that will not love his country? If any, speak, for him have I offended. I pause for a reply. None, Brutus, none. Then none have I offended. I have done no more to Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question of his death is enrolled in the Capitol, his glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy, nor his offenses enforced for which he suffered death. Enter Mark Antony and others with Caesar’s body.

We’ll bring him to his house with shouts and clamors. My countrymen— Peace, silence! Brutus speaks. Peace, ho! Good countrymen, let me depart alone, And, for my sake, stay here with Antony. Do grace to Caesar’s corpse, and grace his speech Tending to Caesar’s glories, which Mark Antony (By our permission) is allowed to make. I do entreat you, not a man depart, Save I alone, till Antony have spoke. He descends and exits. Stay, ho, and let us hear Mark Antony! Let him go up into the public chair.

He says for Brutus’ sake He finds himself beholding to us all. ’Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here. This Caesar was a tyrant. Nay, that’s certain. We are blest that Rome is rid of him. Peace, let us hear what Antony can say. You gentle Romans— Peace, ho! Let us hear him. Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears. I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him. The evil that men do lives after them; The good is oft interrèd with their bones. So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus Hath told you Caesar was ambitious. If it were so, it was a grievous fault, And grievously hath Caesar answered it. Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest (For Brutus is an honorable man; So are they all, all honorable men), Come I to speak in Caesar’s funeral. He was my friend, faithful and just to me, But Brutus says he was ambitious, And Brutus is an honorable man. He hath brought many captives home to Rome, Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill. Did this in Caesar seem ambitious? When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept; Ambition should be made of sterner stuff. Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, And Brutus is an honorable man. You all did see that on the Lupercal I thrice presented him a kingly crown, Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, And sure he is an honorable man. I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, But here I am to speak what I do know. You all did love him once, not without cause. What cause withholds you, then, to mourn for him?— O judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar, And I must pause till it come back to me. He weeps. Methinks there is much reason in his sayings. If thou consider rightly of the matter, Caesar has had great wrong. Has he, masters? I fear there will a worse come in his place. Marked you his words? He would not take the crown; Therefore ’tis certain he was not ambitious. If it be found so, some will dear abide it. Poor soul, his eyes are red as fire with weeping. There’s not a nobler man in Rome than Antony. Now mark him. He begins again to speak. But yesterday the word of Caesar might Have stood against the world. Now lies he there, And none so poor to do him reverence. O masters, if I were disposed to stir Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage, I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong, Who, you all know, are honorable men. I will not do them wrong. I rather choose To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you, Than I will wrong such honorable men. But here’s a parchment with the seal of Caesar. I found it in his closet. ’Tis his will. Let but the commons hear this testament, Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read, And they would go and kiss dead Caesar’s wounds And dip their napkins in his sacred blood— Yea, beg a hair of him for memory And, dying, mention it within their wills, Bequeathing it as a rich legacy Unto their issue. We’ll hear the will. Read it, Mark Antony. The will, the will! We will hear Caesar’s will. Have patience, gentle friends. I must not read it. It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you. You are not wood, you are not stones, but men. And, being men, hearing the will of Caesar, It will inflame you; it will make you mad. ’Tis good you know not that you are his heirs, For if you should, O, what would come of it? Read the will! We’ll hear it, Antony. You shall read us the will, Caesar’s will. Will you be patient? Will you stay awhile? I have o’ershot myself to tell you of it. I fear I wrong the honorable men Whose daggers have stabbed Caesar. I do fear it. They were traitors. Honorable men? The will! The testament! They were villains, murderers. The will! Read the will. You will compel me, then, to read the will? Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar, And let me show you him that made the will. Shall I descend? And will you give me leave? Come down. Descend. You shall have leave. Antony descends. A ring; stand round. Stand from the hearse. Stand from the body. Room for Antony, most noble Antony. Nay, press not so upon me. Stand far off. Stand back! Room! Bear back! If you have tears, prepare to shed them now. You all do know this mantle. I remember The first time ever Caesar put it on. ’Twas on a summer’s evening in his tent, That day he overcame the Nervii. Look, in this place ran Cassius’ dagger through. See what a rent the envious Casca made. Through this the well-belovèd Brutus stabbed, And, as he plucked his cursèd steel away, Mark how the blood of Caesar followed it, As rushing out of doors to be resolved If Brutus so unkindly knocked or no; For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar’s angel. Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him! This was the most unkindest cut of all. For when the noble Caesar saw him stab, Ingratitude, more strong than traitors’ arms, Quite vanquished him. Then burst his mighty heart, And, in his mantle muffling up his face, Even at the base of Pompey’s statue (Which all the while ran blood) great Caesar fell. what a fall was there, my countrymen! Then I and you and all of us fell down, Whilst bloody treason flourished over us. now you weep, and I perceive you feel The dint of pity. These are gracious drops. Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold Our Caesar’s vesture wounded? Look you here, Antony lifts Caesar’s cloak. Here is himself, marred as you see with traitors. O piteous spectacle! O noble Caesar! O woeful day! O traitors, villains! O most bloody sight! We will be revenged. Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill! Slay! Let not a traitor live! Stay, countrymen. Peace there! Hear the noble Antony. We’ll hear him, we’ll follow him, we’ll die with him. Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up To such a sudden flood of mutiny. They that have done this deed are honorable. What private griefs they have, alas, I know not, That made them do it. They are wise and honorable And will no doubt with reasons answer you. I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts. I am no orator, as Brutus is, But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man That love my friend, and that they know full well That gave me public leave to speak of him. For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth, Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech To stir men’s blood. I only speak right on. I tell you that which you yourselves do know, Show you sweet Caesar’s wounds, poor poor dumb mouths, And bid them speak for me. But were I Brutus, And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue In every wound of Caesar that should move The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny. We’ll mutiny. We’ll burn the house of Brutus. Away then. Come, seek the conspirators. Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak. Peace, ho! Hear Antony, most noble Antony! Why, friends, you go to do you know not what. Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves? Alas, you know not. I must tell you then. You have forgot the will I told you of. Most true. The will! Let’s stay and hear the will. Here is the will, and under Caesar’s seal: To every Roman citizen he gives, To every several man, seventy-five drachmas. Most noble Caesar! We’ll revenge his death. O royal Caesar! Hear me with patience. Peace, ho! Moreover, he hath left you all his walks, His private arbors, and new-planted orchards, On this side Tiber. He hath left them you, And to your heirs forever—common pleasures To walk abroad and recreate yourselves. Here was a Caesar! When comes such another? Never, never!—Come, away, away! We’ll burn his body in the holy place And with the brands fire the traitors’ houses. Take up the body. Go fetch fire. Pluck down benches. Pluck down forms, windows, anything. Plebeians exit with Caesar’s body. Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot; Take thou what course thou wilt. Enter Servant. How now, fellow? Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome. Where is he? He and Lepidus are at Caesar’s house. And thither will I straight to visit him. He comes upon a wish. Fortune is merry And in this mood will give us anything. I heard him say Brutus and Cassius Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome. Belike they had some notice of the people How I had moved them. Bring me to Octavius. They exit.",

The commoners' initial enthusiasm, contrasted with their later guilt and dispersal, highlights their susceptibility to manipulation and the fragility of popular opinion.",
      "Why, Antony. Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca. I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it. It was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown (yet ’twas not a crown neither; ’twas one of these coronets), and, as I told you, he put it by once; but for all that, to my thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he offered it to him again; then he put it by again; but to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it. And then he offered it the third time. He put it the third time by, and still as he refused it the rabblement hooted and clapped their chopped hands and threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked Caesar, for he swooned and fell down at it. And for mine own part, I durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air. But soft, I pray you. What, did Caesar swoon? He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and was speechless.",

This is a slight, unmeritable man, Meet to be sent on errands. Is it fit, The threefold world divided, he should stand One of the three to share it? So you thought him And took his voice who should be pricked to die In our black sentence and proscription. Octavius, I have seen more days than you, And, though we lay these honors on this man To ease ourselves of diverse sland’rous loads, He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold, To groan and sweat under the business, Either led or driven, as we point the way; And having brought our treasure where we will, Then take we down his load and turn him off (Like to the empty ass) to shake his ears And graze in commons.

The Generals step forward. Words before blows; is it so, countrymen? Not that we love words better, as you do. Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius. In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words.

Not stingless too. O yes, and soundless too, For you have stolen their buzzing, Antony, And very wisely threat before you sting. Villains, you did not so when your vile daggers Hacked one another in the sides of Caesar.

Flatterers?—Now, Brutus, thank yourself! This tongue had not offended so today If Cassius might have ruled. Come, come, the cause. If arguing make us sweat, The proof of it will turn to redder drops. Look, I draw a sword against conspirators; He draws. When think you that the sword goes up again? Never, till Caesar’s three and thirty wounds Be well avenged, or till another Caesar Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors. Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors’ hands Unless thou bring’st them with thee. So I hope. I was not born to die on Brutus’ sword. if thou wert the noblest of thy strain, Young man, thou couldst not die more honorable.

Messala, This is my birthday, as this very day Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala. Be thou my witness that against my will (As Pompey was) am I compelled to set Upon one battle all our liberties. You know that I held Epicurus strong And his opinion. Now I change my mind And partly credit things that do presage. Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perched, Gorging and feeding from our soldiers’ hands, Who to Philippi here consorted us.

Their shadows seem A canopy most fatal, under which Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost. Believe not so. I but believe it partly, For I am fresh of spirit and resolved To meet all perils very constantly. Even so, Lucilius. Brutus returns to Cassius.

But since the affairs of men rests still incertain, Let’s reason with the worst that may befall. If we do lose this battle, then is this The very last time we shall speak together. What are you then determinèd to do? Even by the rule of that philosophy By which I did blame Cato for the death Which he did give himself (I know not how, But I do find it cowardly and vile, For fear of what might fall, so to prevent The time of life), arming myself with patience To stay the providence of some high powers That govern us below. Then, if we lose this battle, You are contented to be led in triumph Thorough the streets of Rome? No, Cassius, no. Think not, thou noble Roman, That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome. He bears too great a mind. But this same day Must end that work the ides of March begun. And whether we shall meet again, I know not. Therefore our everlasting farewell take. Forever and forever farewell, Cassius. If we do meet again, why we shall smile; If not, why then this parting was well made. Forever and forever farewell, Brutus. If we do meet again, we’ll smile indeed; If not, ’tis true this parting was well made. Why then, lead on.—O, that a man might know The end of this day’s business ere it come!

Then follow me and give me audience, friends.— Cassius, go you into the other street And part the numbers.— Those that will hear me speak, let ’em stay here; Those that will follow Cassius, go with him; And public reasons shall be renderèd Of Caesar’s death. I will hear Brutus speak. I will hear Cassius, and compare their reasons When severally we hear them renderèd. Cassius exits with some of the Plebeians. Brutus goes into the pulpit. The noble Brutus is ascended. Silence. Be patient till the last. Romans, countrymen, and lovers, hear me for my cause, and be silent that you may hear. Believe me for mine honor, and have respect to mine honor that you may believe. Censure me in your wisdom, and awake your senses that you may the better judge. If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of Caesar’s, to him I say that Brutus’ love to Caesar was no less than his. If then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer: not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living, and die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live all freemen? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him. As he was fortunate, I rejoice at it. As he was valiant, I honor him. But, as he was ambitious, I slew him. There is tears for his love, joy for his fortune, honor for his valor, and death for his ambition. Who is here so base that would be a bondman? If any, speak, for him have I offended. Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If any, speak, for him have I offended. Who is here so vile that will not love his country? If any, speak, for him have I offended. I pause for a reply. None, Brutus, none. Then none have I offended. I have done no more to Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question of his death is enrolled in the Capitol, his glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy, nor his offenses enforced for which he suffered death. Enter Mark Antony and others with Caesar’s body. Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony, who, though he had no hand in his death, shall receive the benefit of his dying—a place in the commonwealth—as which of you shall not? With this I depart: that, as I slew my best lover for the good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself when it shall please my country to need my death. Live, Brutus, live, live! Bring him with triumph home unto his house. Give him a statue with his ancestors. Let him be Caesar. Caesar’s better parts Shall be crowned in Brutus. We’ll bring him to his house with shouts and clamors. My countrymen— Peace, silence! Brutus speaks. Peace, ho! Good countrymen, let me depart alone, And, for my sake, stay here with Antony. Do grace to Caesar’s corpse, and grace his speech Tending to Caesar’s glories, which Mark Antony (By our permission) is allowed to make. I do entreat you, not a man depart, Save I alone, till Antony have spoke. He descends and exits. Stay, ho, and let us hear Mark Antony! Let him go up into the public chair. We’ll hear him.—Noble Antony, go up. For Brutus’ sake, I am beholding to you. He goes into the pulpit. What does he say of Brutus? He says for Brutus’ sake He finds himself beholding to us all. ’Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here. This Caesar was a tyrant. Nay, that’s certain. We are blest that Rome is rid of him. Peace, let us hear what Antony can say. You gentle Romans— Peace, ho! Let us hear him. Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears. I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him. The evil that men do lives after them; The good is oft interrèd with their bones. So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus Hath told you Caesar was ambitious. If it were so, it was a grievous fault, And grievously hath Caesar answered it. Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest (For Brutus is an honorable man; So are they all, all honorable men), Come I to speak in Caesar’s funeral. He was my friend, faithful and just to me, But Brutus says he was ambitious, And Brutus is an honorable man. He hath brought many captives home to Rome, Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill. Did this in Caesar seem ambitious? When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept; Ambition should be made of sterner stuff. Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, And Brutus is an honorable man. You all did see that on the Lupercal I thrice presented him a kingly crown, Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, And sure he is an honorable man. I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, But here I am to speak what I do know. You all did love him once, not without cause. What cause withholds you, then, to mourn for him?— O judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar, And I must pause till it come back to me. He weeps. Methinks there is much reason in his sayings. If thou consider rightly of the matter, Caesar has had great wrong. Has he, masters? I fear there will a worse come in his place. Marked you his words? He would not take the crown; Therefore ’tis certain he was not ambitious. If it be found so, some will dear abide it. Poor soul, his eyes are red as fire with weeping. There’s not a nobler man in Rome than Antony. Now mark him. He begins again to speak. But yesterday the word of Caesar might Have stood against the world. Now lies he there, And none so poor to do him reverence. O masters, if I were disposed to stir Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage, I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong, Who, you all know, are honorable men. I will not do them wrong. I rather choose To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you, Than I will wrong such honorable men. But here’s a parchment with the seal of Caesar. I found it in his closet. ’Tis his will. Let but the commons hear this testament, Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read, And they would go and kiss dead Caesar’s wounds And dip their napkins in his sacred blood— Yea, beg a hair of him for memory And, dying, mention it within their wills, Bequeathing it as a rich legacy Unto their issue. We’ll hear the will. Read it, Mark Antony. The will, the will! We will hear Caesar’s will. Have patience, gentle friends. I must not read it. It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you. You are not wood, you are not stones, but men. And, being men, hearing the will of Caesar, It will inflame you; it will make you mad. ’Tis good you know not that you are his heirs, For if you should, O, what would come of it? Read the will! We’ll hear it, Antony. You shall read us the will, Caesar’s will. Will you be patient? Will you stay awhile? I have o’ershot myself to tell you of it. I fear I wrong the honorable men Whose daggers have stabbed Caesar. I do fear it. They were traitors. Honorable men? The will! The testament! They were villains, murderers. The will! Read the will. You will compel me, then, to read the will? Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar, And let me show you him that made the will. Shall I descend? And will you give me leave? Come down. Descend. You shall have leave. Antony descends. A ring; stand round. Stand from the hearse. Stand from the body. Room for Antony, most noble Antony. Nay, press not so upon me. Stand far off. Stand back! Room! Bear back! If you have tears, prepare to shed them now. You all do know this mantle. I remember The first time ever Caesar put it on. ’Twas on a summer’s evening in his tent, That day he overcame the Nervii. Look, in this place ran Cassius’ dagger through. See what a rent the envious Casca made. Through this the well-belovèd Brutus stabbed, And, as he plucked his cursèd steel away, Mark how the blood of Caesar followed it, As rushing out of doors to be resolved If Brutus so unkindly knocked or no; For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar’s angel. Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him! This was the most unkindest cut of all. For when the noble Caesar saw him stab, Ingratitude, more strong than traitors’ arms, Quite vanquished him. Then burst his mighty heart, And, in his mantle muffling up his face, Even at the base of Pompey’s statue (Which all the while ran blood) great Caesar fell. what a fall was there, my countrymen! Then I and you and all of us fell down, Whilst bloody treason flourished over us. now you weep, and I perceive you feel The dint of pity. These are gracious drops. Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold Our Caesar’s vesture wounded? Look you here, Antony lifts Caesar’s cloak. Here is himself, marred as you see with traitors. O piteous spectacle! O noble Caesar! O woeful day! O traitors, villains! O most bloody sight! We will be revenged. Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill! Slay! Let not a traitor live! Stay, countrymen. Peace there! Hear the noble Antony. We’ll hear him, we’ll follow him, we’ll die with him. Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up To such a sudden flood of mutiny. They that have done this deed are honorable. What private griefs they have, alas, I know not, That made them do it. They are wise and honorable And will no doubt with reasons answer you. I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts. I am no orator, as Brutus is, But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man That love my friend, and that they know full well That gave me public leave to speak of him. For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth, Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech To stir men’s blood. I only speak right on. I tell you that which you yourselves do know, Show you sweet Caesar’s wounds, poor poor dumb mouths, And bid them speak for me. But were I Brutus, And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue In every wound of Caesar that should move The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny. We’ll mutiny. We’ll burn the house of Brutus. Away then. Come, seek the conspirators. Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak. Peace, ho! Hear Antony, most noble Antony! Why, friends, you go to do you know not what. Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves? Alas, you know not. I must tell you then. You have forgot the will I told you of. Most true. The will! Let’s stay and hear the will. Here is the will, and under Caesar’s seal: To every Roman citizen he gives, To every several man, seventy-five drachmas. Most noble Caesar! We’ll revenge his death. O royal Caesar! Hear me with patience. Peace, ho! Moreover, he hath left you all his walks, His private arbors, and new-planted orchards, On this side Tiber. He hath left them you, And to your heirs forever—common pleasures To walk abroad and recreate yourselves. Here was a Caesar! When comes such another? Never, never!—Come, away, away! We’ll burn his body in the holy place And with the brands fire the traitors’ houses. Take up the body. Go fetch fire. Pluck down benches. Pluck down forms, windows, anything. Plebeians exit with Caesar’s body. Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot; Take thou what course thou wilt. Enter Servant. How now, fellow? Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome. Where is he? He and Lepidus are at Caesar’s house. And thither will I straight to visit him. He comes upon a wish. Fortune is merry And in this mood will give us anything. I heard him say Brutus and Cassius Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome. Belike they had some notice of the people How I had moved them. Bring me to Octavius. They exit.",

Cassius's emotional volatility and sense of being unappreciated contrasts sharply with Brutus's stoic demeanor and commitment to justice, creating political tension. This conflict leads to a temporary reconciliation, underscored by the news of Portia's death, which serves as a catalyst for them to set aside their differences and focus on the impending battle.

The gods defend him from so great a shame! When you do find him, or alive or dead, He will be found like Brutus, like himself. This is not Brutus, friend, but I assure you, A prize no less in worth.

If arguing make us sweat, The proof of it will turn to redder drops. Look, I draw a sword against conspirators; He draws. When think you that the sword goes up again? Never, till Caesar’s three and thirty wounds Be well avenged, or till another Caesar Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors. Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors’ hands Unless thou bring’st them with thee. So I hope.

    "question": "What news do Brutus and Cassius receive from Rome?",
    "contexts": [
      "Enter Brutus and Cassius with the Plebeians. We will be satisfied! Let us be satisfied! Then follow me and give me audience, friends.— Cassius, go you into the other street And part the numbers.— Those that will hear me speak, let ’em stay here; Those that will follow Cassius, go with him; And public reasons shall be renderèd Of Caesar’s death. I will hear Brutus speak. I will hear Cassius, and compare their reasons When severally we hear them renderèd. Cassius exits with some of the Plebeians. Brutus goes into the pulpit. The noble Brutus is ascended. Silence. Be patient till the last. Romans, countrymen, and lovers, hear me for my cause, and be silent that you may hear. Believe me for mine honor, and have respect to mine honor that you may believe. Censure me in your wisdom, and awake your senses that you may the better judge. If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of Caesar’s, to him I say that Brutus’ love to Caesar was no less than his. If then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer: not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living, and die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live all freemen? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him. As he was fortunate, I rejoice at it. As he was valiant, I honor him. But, as he was ambitious, I slew him. There is tears for his love, joy for his fortune, honor for his valor, and death for his ambition. Who is here so base that would be a bondman? If any, speak, for him have I offended. Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If any, speak, for him have I offended. Who is here so vile that will not love his country? If any, speak, for him have I offended. I pause for a reply. None, Brutus, none. Then none have I offended. I have done no more to Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question of his death is enrolled in the Capitol, his glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy, nor his offenses enforced for which he suffered death. Enter Mark Antony and others with Caesar’s body. Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony, who, though he had no hand in his death, shall receive the benefit of his dying—a place in the commonwealth—as which of you shall not? With this I depart: that, as I slew my best lover for the good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself when it shall please my country to need my death. Live, Brutus, live, live! Bring him with triumph home unto his house. Give him a statue with his ancestors. Let him be Caesar. Caesar’s better parts Shall be crowned in Brutus. We’ll bring him to his house with shouts and clamors. My countrymen— Peace, silence! Brutus speaks. Peace, ho! Good countrymen, let me depart alone, And, for my sake, stay here with Antony. Do grace to Caesar’s corpse, and grace his speech Tending to Caesar’s glories, which Mark Antony (By our permission) is allowed to make. I do entreat you, not a man depart, Save I alone, till Antony have spoke. He descends and exits. Stay, ho, and let us hear Mark Antony! Let him go up into the public chair. We’ll hear him.—Noble Antony, go up. For Brutus’ sake, I am beholding to you. He goes into the pulpit. What does he say of Brutus? He says for Brutus’ sake He finds himself beholding to us all. ’Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here. This Caesar was a tyrant. Nay, that’s certain. We are blest that Rome is rid of him. Peace, let us hear what Antony can say. You gentle Romans— Peace, ho! Let us hear him. Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears. I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him. The evil that men do lives after them; The good is oft interrèd with their bones. So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus Hath told you Caesar was ambitious. If it were so, it was a grievous fault, And grievously hath Caesar answered it. Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest (For Brutus is an honorable man; So are they all, all honorable men), Come I to speak in Caesar’s funeral. He was my friend, faithful and just to me, But Brutus says he was ambitious, And Brutus is an honorable man. He hath brought many captives home to Rome, Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill. Did this in Caesar seem ambitious? When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept; Ambition should be made of sterner stuff. Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, And Brutus is an honorable man. You all did see that on the Lupercal I thrice presented him a kingly crown, Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, And sure he is an honorable man. I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, But here I am to speak what I do know. You all did love him once, not without cause. What cause withholds you, then, to mourn for him?— O judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar, And I must pause till it come back to me. He weeps. Methinks there is much reason in his sayings. If thou consider rightly of the matter, Caesar has had great wrong. Has he, masters? I fear there will a worse come in his place. Marked you his words? He would not take the crown; Therefore ’tis certain he was not ambitious. If it be found so, some will dear abide it. Poor soul, his eyes are red as fire with weeping. There’s not a nobler man in Rome than Antony. Now mark him. He begins again to speak. But yesterday the word of Caesar might Have stood against the world. Now lies he there, And none so poor to do him reverence. O masters, if I were disposed to stir Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage, I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong, Who, you all know, are honorable men. I will not do them wrong. I rather choose To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you, Than I will wrong such honorable men. But here’s a parchment with the seal of Caesar. I found it in his closet. ’Tis his will. Let but the commons hear this testament, Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read, And they would go and kiss dead Caesar’s wounds And dip their napkins in his sacred blood— Yea, beg a hair of him for memory And, dying, mention it within their wills, Bequeathing it as a rich legacy Unto their issue. We’ll hear the will. Read it, Mark Antony. The will, the will! We will hear Caesar’s will. Have patience, gentle friends. I must not read it. It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you. You are not wood, you are not stones, but men. And, being men, hearing the will of Caesar, It will inflame you; it will make you mad. ’Tis good you know not that you are his heirs, For if you should, O, what would come of it? Read the will! We’ll hear it, Antony. You shall read us the will, Caesar’s will. Will you be patient? Will you stay awhile? I have o’ershot myself to tell you of it. I fear I wrong the honorable men Whose daggers have stabbed Caesar. I do fear it. They were traitors. Honorable men? The will! The testament! They were villains, murderers. The will! Read the will. You will compel me, then, to read the will? Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar, And let me show you him that made the will. Shall I descend? And will you give me leave? Come down. Descend. You shall have leave. Antony descends. A ring; stand round. Stand from the hearse. Stand from the body. Room for Antony, most noble Antony. Nay, press not so upon me. Stand far off. Stand back! Room! Bear back! If you have tears, prepare to shed them now. You all do know this mantle. I remember The first time ever Caesar put it on. ’Twas on a summer’s evening in his tent, That day he overcame the Nervii. Look, in this place ran Cassius’ dagger through. See what a rent the envious Casca made. Through this the well-belovèd Brutus stabbed, And, as he plucked his cursèd steel away, Mark how the blood of Caesar followed it, As rushing out of doors to be resolved If Brutus so unkindly knocked or no; For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar’s angel. Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him! This was the most unkindest cut of all. For when the noble Caesar saw him stab, Ingratitude, more strong than traitors’ arms, Quite vanquished him. Then burst his mighty heart, And, in his mantle muffling up his face, Even at the base of Pompey’s statue (Which all the while ran blood) great Caesar fell. what a fall was there, my countrymen! Then I and you and all of us fell down, Whilst bloody treason flourished over us. now you weep, and I perceive you feel The dint of pity. These are gracious drops. Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold Our Caesar’s vesture wounded? Look you here, Antony lifts Caesar’s cloak. Here is himself, marred as you see with traitors. O piteous spectacle! O noble Caesar! O woeful day! O traitors, villains! O most bloody sight! We will be revenged. Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill! Slay! Let not a traitor live! Stay, countrymen. Peace there! Hear the noble Antony. We’ll hear him, we’ll follow him, we’ll die with him. Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up To such a sudden flood of mutiny. They that have done this deed are honorable. What private griefs they have, alas, I know not, That made them do it. They are wise and honorable And will no doubt with reasons answer you.

Enter Lucius. LUCIUS Called you, my lord? Get me a taper in my study, Lucius. When it is lighted, come and call me here. I will, my lord. He exits. It must be by his death. And for my part I know no personal cause to spurn at him, But for the general. He would be crowned: How that might change his nature, there’s the question. It is the bright day that brings forth the adder, And that craves wary walking. Crown him that, And then I grant we put a sting in him That at his will he may do danger with. Th’ abuse of greatness is when it disjoins Remorse from power. And, to speak truth of Caesar, I have not known when his affections swayed More than his reason. But ’tis a common proof That lowliness is young ambition’s ladder, Whereto the climber-upward turns his face; But, when he once attains the upmost round, He then unto the ladder turns his back, Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees By which he did ascend. So Caesar may. Then, lest he may, prevent. And since the quarrel Will bear no color for the thing he is, Fashion it thus: that what he is, augmented, Would run to these and these extremities. And therefore think him as a serpent’s egg, Which, hatched, would, as his kind, grow mischievous, And kill him in the shell. Enter Lucius. The taper burneth in your closet, sir. Searching the window for a flint, I found This paper, thus sealed up, and I am sure It did not lie there when I went to bed. Gives him the letter. Get you to bed again. It is not day. Is not tomorrow, boy, the ides of March? I know not, sir. Look in the calendar, and bring me word. I will, sir. He exits. The exhalations, whizzing in the air, Give so much light that I may read by them. Opens the letter and reads. Brutus, thou sleep’st. Awake, and see thyself! Shall Rome, etc. Speak, strike, redress! “Brutus, thou sleep’st. Awake.” Such instigations have been often dropped Where I have took them up. “Shall Rome, etc.” Thus must I piece it out: Shall Rome stand under one man’s awe? What, Rome? My ancestors did from the streets of Rome The Tarquin drive when he was called a king. “Speak, strike, redress!” Am I entreated To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise, If the redress will follow, thou receivest Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus. Enter Lucius. Sir, March is wasted fifteen days. Knock within. ’Tis good. Go to the gate; somebody knocks. Lucius exits. Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar, I have not slept. Between the acting of a dreadful thing And the first motion, all the interim is Like a phantasma or a hideous dream. The genius and the mortal instruments Are then in council, and the state of man, Like to a little kingdom, suffers then The nature of an insurrection. Enter Lucius. Sir, ’tis your brother Cassius at the door, Who doth desire to see you. Is he alone? No, sir. There are more with him. Do you know them? No, sir. Their hats are plucked about their ears, And half their faces buried in their cloaks, That by no means I may discover them By any mark of favor. Let ’em enter. Lucius exits. They are the faction. O conspiracy, Sham’st thou to show thy dang’rous brow by night, When evils are most free? O, then, by day Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, conspiracy. Hide it in smiles and affability; For if thou path, thy native semblance on, Not Erebus itself were dim enough To hide thee from prevention. Enter the conspirators, Cassius, Casca, Decius, Cinna, Metellus, and Trebonius. I think we are too bold upon your rest. Good morrow, Brutus. Do we trouble you? I have been up this hour, awake all night. Know I these men that come along with you? Yes, every man of them; and no man here But honors you, and every one doth wish You had but that opinion of yourself Which every noble Roman bears of you. This is Trebonius. He is welcome hither. This, Decius Brutus. He is welcome too. This, Casca; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus Cimber. They are all welcome. What watchful cares do interpose themselves Betwixt your eyes and night? Shall I entreat a word? Brutus and Cassius whisper. Here lies the east; doth not the day break here? No. O pardon, sir, it doth; and yon gray lines That fret the clouds are messengers of day. You shall confess that you are both deceived. Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises, Which is a great way growing on the south, Weighing the youthful season of the year. Some two months hence, up higher toward the north He first presents his fire, and the high east Stands, as the Capitol, directly here. coming forward with Cassius Give me your hands all over, one by one. And let us swear our resolution. No, not an oath. If not the face of men, The sufferance of our souls, the time’s abuse— If these be motives weak, break off betimes, And every man hence to his idle bed. So let high-sighted tyranny range on Till each man drop by lottery. But if these— As I am sure they do—bear fire enough To kindle cowards and to steel with valor The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen, What need we any spur but our own cause To prick us to redress? What other bond Than secret Romans that have spoke the word And will not palter? And what other oath Than honesty to honesty engaged That this shall be or we will fall for it? Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous, Old feeble carrions, and such suffering souls That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain The even virtue of our enterprise, Nor th’ insuppressive mettle of our spirits, To think that or our cause or our performance Did need an oath, when every drop of blood That every Roman bears, and nobly bears, Is guilty of a several bastardy If he do break the smallest particle Of any promise that hath passed from him. But what of Cicero? Shall we sound him? I think he will stand very strong with us. Let us not leave him out. No, by no means. let us have him, for his silver hairs Will purchase us a good opinion And buy men’s voices to commend our deeds. It shall be said his judgment ruled our hands. Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear, But all be buried in his gravity. name him not! Let us not break with him, For he will never follow anything That other men begin. Then leave him out. Indeed, he is not fit. Shall no man else be touched, but only Caesar? Decius, well urged. I think it is not meet Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar, Should outlive Caesar. We shall find of him A shrewd contriver; and, you know, his means, If he improve them, may well stretch so far As to annoy us all; which to prevent, Let Antony and Caesar fall together. Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius, To cut the head off and then hack the limbs, Like wrath in death and envy afterwards; For Antony is but a limb of Caesar. Let’s be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius. We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar, And in the spirit of men there is no blood. that we then could come by Caesar’s spirit And not dismember Caesar! But, alas, Caesar must bleed for it. And, gentle friends, Let’s kill him boldly, but not wrathfully. Let’s carve him as a dish fit for the gods, Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds. And let our hearts, as subtle masters do, Stir up their servants to an act of rage And after seem to chide ’em. This shall make Our purpose necessary and not envious; Which so appearing to the common eyes, We shall be called purgers, not murderers. And for Mark Antony, think not of him, For he can do no more than Caesar’s arm When Caesar’s head is off. Yet I fear him, For in the engrafted love he bears to Caesar— Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him. If he love Caesar, all that he can do Is to himself: take thought and die for Caesar. And that were much he should, for he is given To sports, to wildness, and much company. There is no fear in him. Let him not die, For he will live and laugh at this hereafter. Clock strikes. Peace, count the clock. The clock hath stricken three. ’Tis time to part. But it is doubtful yet Whether Caesar will come forth today or no, For he is superstitious grown of late, Quite from the main opinion he held once Of fantasy, of dreams, and ceremonies. It may be these apparent prodigies, The unaccustomed terror of this night, And the persuasion of his augurers May hold him from the Capitol today. Never fear that. If he be so resolved, I can o’ersway him, for he loves to hear That unicorns may be betrayed with trees, And bears with glasses, elephants with holes, Lions with toils, and men with flatterers. But when I tell him he hates flatterers, He says he does, being then most flatterèd. Let me work, For I can give his humor the true bent, And I will bring him to the Capitol. Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him. By the eighth hour, is that the uttermost? Be that the uttermost, and fail not then. Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard, Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey. I wonder none of you have thought of him. Now, good Metellus, go along by him. He loves me well, and I have given him reasons. Send him but hither, and I’ll fashion him. The morning comes upon ’s. We’ll leave you, Brutus. And, friends, disperse yourselves, but all remember What you have said, and show yourselves true Romans. Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily. Let not our looks put on our purposes, But bear it, as our Roman actors do, With untired spirits and formal constancy. And so good morrow to you every one. All but Brutus exit. Boy! Lucius!—Fast asleep? It is no matter. Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber. Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies Which busy care draws in the brains of men. Therefore thou sleep’st so sound. Enter Portia. Brutus, my lord. Portia! What mean you? Wherefore rise you now? It is not for your health thus to commit Your weak condition to the raw cold morning. Nor for yours neither. You’ve ungently, Brutus, Stole from my bed. And yesternight at supper You suddenly arose and walked about, Musing and sighing, with your arms across, And when I asked you what the matter was, You stared upon me with ungentle looks. I urged you further; then you scratched your head And too impatiently stamped with your foot. Yet I insisted; yet you answered not, But with an angry wafture of your hand Gave sign for me to leave you. So I did, Fearing to strengthen that impatience Which seemed too much enkindled, and withal Hoping it was but an effect of humor, Which sometime hath his hour with every man. It will not let you eat nor talk nor sleep, And could it work so much upon your shape As it hath much prevailed on your condition, I should not know you Brutus. Dear my lord, Make me acquainted with your cause of grief. I am not well in health, and that is all. Brutus is wise and, were he not in health, He would embrace the means to come by it. Why so I do. Good Portia, go to bed. Is Brutus sick? And is it physical To walk unbracèd and suck up the humors Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick, And will he steal out of his wholesome bed To dare the vile contagion of the night And tempt the rheumy and unpurgèd air To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus, You have some sick offense within your mind, Which by the right and virtue of my place I ought to know of. She kneels. And upon my knees I charm you, by my once commended beauty, By all your vows of love, and that great vow Which did incorporate and make us one, That you unfold to me, your self, your half, Why you are heavy, and what men tonight Have had resort to you; for here have been Some six or seven who did hide their faces Even from darkness. Kneel not, gentle Portia. He lifts her up. I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus. Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus, Is it excepted I should know no secrets That appertain to you? Am I your self But, as it were, in sort or limitation, To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed, And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbs Of your good pleasure? If it be no more, Portia is Brutus’ harlot, not his wife. You are my true and honorable wife, As dear to me as are the ruddy drops That visit my sad heart. If this were true, then should I know this secret. I grant I am a woman, but withal A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife. I grant I am a woman, but withal A woman well-reputed, Cato’s daughter. Think you I am no stronger than my sex, Being so fathered and so husbanded? Tell me your counsels; I will not disclose ’em. I have made strong proof of my constancy, Giving myself a voluntary wound Here, in the thigh. Can I bear that with patience, And not my husband’s secrets? O you gods, Render me worthy of this noble wife! Knock. Hark, hark, one knocks. Portia, go in awhile, And by and by thy bosom shall partake The secrets of my heart. All my engagements I will construe to thee, All the charactery of my sad brows. Leave me with haste. Portia exits. Lucius, who ’s that knocks? Enter Lucius and Ligarius. Here is a sick man that would speak with you. Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spoke of.— Boy, stand aside. Lucius exits. Caius Ligarius, how? Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue. what a time have you chose out, brave Caius, To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick! I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand Any exploit worthy the name of honor. Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius, Had you a healthful ear to hear of it. By all the gods that Romans bow before, I here discard my sickness. He takes off his kerchief. Soul of Rome, Brave son derived from honorable loins, Thou like an exorcist hast conjured up My mortifièd spirit. Now bid me run, And I will strive with things impossible, Yea, get the better of them. What’s to do? A piece of work that will make sick men whole. But are not some whole that we must make sick? That must we also. What it is, my Caius, I shall unfold to thee as we are going To whom it must be done. Set on your foot, And with a heart new-fired I follow you To do I know not what; but it sufficeth That Brutus leads me on. Thunder. Follow me then. They exit.",

      "Enter Brutus and Cassius with the Plebeians. We will be satisfied! Let us be satisfied! Then follow me and give me audience, friends.— Cassius, go you into the other street And part the numbers.— Those that will hear me speak, let ’em stay here; Those that will follow Cassius, go with him; And public reasons shall be renderèd Of Caesar’s death. I will hear Brutus speak. I will hear Cassius, and compare their reasons When severally we hear them renderèd. Cassius exits with some of the Plebeians. Brutus goes into the pulpit. The noble Brutus is ascended. Silence. Be patient till the last. Romans, countrymen, and lovers, hear me for my cause, and be silent that you may hear. Believe me for mine honor, and have respect to mine honor that you may believe. Censure me in your wisdom, and awake your senses that you may the better judge. If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of Caesar’s, to him I say that Brutus’ love to Caesar was no less than his. If then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer: not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living, and die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live all freemen? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him. As he was fortunate, I rejoice at it. As he was valiant, I honor him. But, as he was ambitious, I slew him. There is tears for his love, joy for his fortune, honor for his valor, and death for his ambition. Who is here so base that would be a bondman? If any, speak, for him have I offended. Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If any, speak, for him have I offended. Who is here so vile that will not love his country? If any, speak, for him have I offended. I pause for a reply. None, Brutus, none. Then none have I offended. I have done no more to Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question of his death is enrolled in the Capitol, his glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy, nor his offenses enforced for which he suffered death. Enter Mark Antony and others with Caesar’s body. Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony, who, though he had no hand in his death, shall receive the benefit of his dying—a place in the commonwealth—as which of you shall not? With this I depart: that, as I slew my best lover for the good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself when it shall please my country to need my death. Live, Brutus, live, live! Bring him with triumph home unto his house. Give him a statue with his ancestors. Let him be Caesar. Caesar’s better parts Shall be crowned in Brutus. We’ll bring him to his house with shouts and clamors. My countrymen— Peace, silence! Brutus speaks. Peace, ho! Good countrymen, let me depart alone, And, for my sake, stay here with Antony. Do grace to Caesar’s corpse, and grace his speech Tending to Caesar’s glories, which Mark Antony (By our permission) is allowed to make. I do entreat you, not a man depart, Save I alone, till Antony have spoke. He descends and exits. Stay, ho, and let us hear Mark Antony! Let him go up into the public chair. We’ll hear him.—Noble Antony, go up. For Brutus’ sake, I am beholding to you. He goes into the pulpit. What does he say of Brutus? He says for Brutus’ sake He finds himself beholding to us all. ’Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here. This Caesar was a tyrant. Nay, that’s certain. We are blest that Rome is rid of him. Peace, let us hear what Antony can say. You gentle Romans— Peace, ho! Let us hear him. Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears. I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him. The evil that men do lives after them; The good is oft interrèd with their bones. So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus Hath told you Caesar was ambitious. If it were so, it was a grievous fault, And grievously hath Caesar answered it. Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest (For Brutus is an honorable man; So are they all, all honorable men), Come I to speak in Caesar’s funeral. He was my friend, faithful and just to me, But Brutus says he was ambitious, And Brutus is an honorable man. He hath brought many captives home to Rome, Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill. Did this in Caesar seem ambitious? When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept; Ambition should be made of sterner stuff. Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, And Brutus is an honorable man. You all did see that on the Lupercal I thrice presented him a kingly crown, Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, And sure he is an honorable man. I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, But here I am to speak what I do know. You all did love him once, not without cause. What cause withholds you, then, to mourn for him?— O judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar, And I must pause till it come back to me. He weeps. Methinks there is much reason in his sayings. If thou consider rightly of the matter, Caesar has had great wrong. Has he, masters? I fear there will a worse come in his place. Marked you his words? He would not take the crown; Therefore ’tis certain he was not ambitious. If it be found so, some will dear abide it. Poor soul, his eyes are red as fire with weeping. There’s not a nobler man in Rome than Antony. Now mark him. He begins again to speak. But yesterday the word of Caesar might Have stood against the world. Now lies he there, And none so poor to do him reverence. O masters, if I were disposed to stir Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage, I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong, Who, you all know, are honorable men. I will not do them wrong. I rather choose To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you, Than I will wrong such honorable men. But here’s a parchment with the seal of Caesar. I found it in his closet. ’Tis his will. Let but the commons hear this testament, Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read, And they would go and kiss dead Caesar’s wounds And dip their napkins in his sacred blood— Yea, beg a hair of him for memory And, dying, mention it within their wills, Bequeathing it as a rich legacy Unto their issue. We’ll hear the will. Read it, Mark Antony. The will, the will! We will hear Caesar’s will. Have patience, gentle friends. I must not read it. It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you. You are not wood, you are not stones, but men. And, being men, hearing the will of Caesar, It will inflame you; it will make you mad. ’Tis good you know not that you are his heirs, For if you should, O, what would come of it? Read the will! We’ll hear it, Antony. You shall read us the will, Caesar’s will. Will you be patient? Will you stay awhile? I have o’ershot myself to tell you of it. I fear I wrong the honorable men Whose daggers have stabbed Caesar. I do fear it. They were traitors. Honorable men? The will! The testament! They were villains, murderers. The will! Read the will. You will compel me, then, to read the will? Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar, And let me show you him that made the will. Shall I descend? And will you give me leave? Come down. Descend. You shall have leave. Antony descends. A ring; stand round. Stand from the hearse. Stand from the body. Room for Antony, most noble Antony. Nay, press not so upon me. Stand far off. Stand back! Room! Bear back! If you have tears, prepare to shed them now. You all do know this mantle. I remember The first time ever Caesar put it on. ’Twas on a summer’s evening in his tent, That day he overcame the Nervii. Look, in this place ran Cassius’ dagger through. See what a rent the envious Casca made. Through this the well-belovèd Brutus stabbed, And, as he plucked his cursèd steel away, Mark how the blood of Caesar followed it, As rushing out of doors to be resolved If Brutus so unkindly knocked or no; For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar’s angel. Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him! This was the most unkindest cut of all. For when the noble Caesar saw him stab, Ingratitude, more strong than traitors’ arms, Quite vanquished him. Then burst his mighty heart, And, in his mantle muffling up his face, Even at the base of Pompey’s statue (Which all the while ran blood) great Caesar fell. what a fall was there, my countrymen! Then I and you and all of us fell down, Whilst bloody treason flourished over us. now you weep, and I perceive you feel The dint of pity. These are gracious drops. Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold Our Caesar’s vesture wounded? Look you here, Antony lifts Caesar’s cloak. Here is himself, marred as you see with traitors. O piteous spectacle! O noble Caesar! O woeful day! O traitors, villains! O most bloody sight! We will be revenged. Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill! Slay! Let not a traitor live! Stay, countrymen. Peace there! Hear the noble Antony. We’ll hear him, we’ll follow him, we’ll die with him. Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up To such a sudden flood of mutiny. They that have done this deed are honorable. What private griefs they have, alas, I know not, That made them do it. They are wise and honorable And will no doubt with reasons answer you. I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts. I am no orator, as Brutus is, But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man That love my friend, and that they know full well That gave me public leave to speak of him. For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth, Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech To stir men’s blood. I only speak right on. I tell you that which you yourselves do know, Show you sweet Caesar’s wounds, poor poor dumb mouths, And bid them speak for me. But were I Brutus, And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue In every wound of Caesar that should move The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny. We’ll mutiny. We’ll burn the house of Brutus. Away then. Come, seek the conspirators. Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak. Peace, ho! Hear Antony, most noble Antony! Why, friends, you go to do you know not what. Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves? Alas, you know not. I must tell you then. You have forgot the will I told you of. Most true. The will! Let’s stay and hear the will. Here is the will, and under Caesar’s seal: To every Roman citizen he gives, To every several man, seventy-five drachmas. Most noble Caesar! We’ll revenge his death. O royal Caesar! Hear me with patience. Peace, ho! Moreover, he hath left you all his walks, His private arbors, and new-planted orchards, On this side Tiber. He hath left them you, And to your heirs forever—common pleasures To walk abroad and recreate yourselves. Here was a Caesar! When comes such another? Never, never!—Come, away, away! We’ll burn his body in the holy place And with the brands fire the traitors’ houses. Take up the body. Go fetch fire. Pluck down benches. Pluck down forms, windows, anything. Plebeians exit with Caesar’s body. Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot; Take thou what course thou wilt. Enter Servant. How now, fellow? Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome. Where is he? He and Lepidus are at Caesar’s house. And thither will I straight to visit him. He comes upon a wish. Fortune is merry And in this mood will give us anything.

Cassius exploits Casca's fear and superstition, transforming the natural phenomena into omens of Caesar's tyranny. He strategically uses the storm to justify his conspiracy, arguing that extraordinary events demand extraordinary action. Cassius's motivation stems from a desire to dismantle Caesar's growing power, while Casca's fear makes him susceptible to Cassius's influence, setting the stage for the conspiracy to gain momentum.",

That you have wronged me doth appear in this: You have condemned and noted Lucius Pella For taking bribes here of the Sardians, Wherein my letters, praying on his side Because I knew the man, was slighted off. You wronged yourself to write in such a case.",

      "You have done that you should be sorry for. There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats, For I am armed so strong in honesty That they pass by me as the idle wind, Which I respect not. I did send to you For certain sums of gold, which you denied me, For I can raise no money by vile means. By heaven, I had rather coin my heart And drop my blood for drachmas than to wring From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash By any indirection. I did send To you for gold to pay my legions, Which you denied me. Was that done like Cassius? Should I have answered Caius Cassius so? When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous To lock such rascal counters from his friends, Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts; Dash him to pieces!",

He is or ta’en or slain. Sit thee down, Clitus. Slaying is the word; It is a deed in fashion. Hark thee, Clitus. He whispers to Clitus. What, I, my lord? No, not for all the world. Peace, then, no words. I’ll rather kill myself. Hark thee, Dardanus. He whispers to Dardanus. Shall I do such a deed? O Dardanus! O Clitus! Dardanus and Clitus step aside. What ill request did Brutus make to thee? To kill him, Clitus. Look, he meditates. Now is that noble vessel full of grief, That it runs over even at his eyes. Come hither, good Volumnius. List a word. What says my lord? Why this, Volumnius: The ghost of Caesar hath appeared to me Two several times by night—at Sardis once And this last night here in Philippi fields. I know my hour is come. Not so, my lord. Nay, I am sure it is, Volumnius. Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes. Our enemies have beat us to the pit. Low alarums. It is more worthy to leap in ourselves Than tarry till they push us. Good Volumnius, Thou know’st that we two went to school together; Even for that our love of old, I prithee, Hold thou my sword hilts whilst I run on it. That’s not an office for a friend, my lord. Alarum continues. Fly, fly, my lord! There is no tarrying here. Farewell to you—and you—and you, Volumnius.— Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep. Farewell to thee, too, Strato.—Countrymen, My heart doth joy that yet in all my life I found no man but he was true to me. I shall have glory by this losing day More than Octavius and Mark Antony By this vile conquest shall attain unto. So fare you well at once, for Brutus’ tongue Hath almost ended his life’s history. Night hangs upon mine eyes; my bones would rest, That have but labored to attain this hour. Alarum. Cry within “Fly, fly, fly!” Fly, my lord, fly! Hence. I will follow.

Hold, then, my sword, and turn away thy face While I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato? Give me your hand first. Fare you well, my lord. Farewell, good Strato. Brutus runs on his sword. Caesar, now be still. I killed not thee with half so good a will. He dies. Alarum. Retreat. Enter Antony, Octavius, Messala, Lucilius, and the army. What man is that? My master’s man.—Strato, where is thy master? Free from the bondage you are in, Messala. The conquerors can but make a fire of him, For Brutus only overcame himself, And no man else hath honor by his death. So Brutus should be found.—I thank thee, Brutus, That thou hast proved Lucilius’ saying true. All that served Brutus, I will entertain them.— Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me? Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you. Do so, good Messala. How died my master, Strato? I held the sword, and he did run on it. Octavius, then take him to follow thee, That did the latest service to my master. This was the noblest Roman of them all. All the conspirators save only he Did that they did in envy of great Caesar. He only in a general honest thought And common good to all made one of them. His life was gentle and the elements So mixed in him that nature might stand up And say to all the world “This was a man.” According to his virtue, let us use him With all respect and rites of burial.

Then follow me and give me audience, friends.— Cassius, go you into the other street And part the numbers.— Those that will hear me speak, let ’em stay here; Those that will follow Cassius, go with him; And public reasons shall be renderèd Of Caesar’s death. I will hear Brutus speak. I will hear Cassius, and compare their reasons When severally we hear them renderèd. Cassius exits with some of the Plebeians. Brutus goes into the pulpit. The noble Brutus is ascended. Silence. Be patient till the last. Romans, countrymen, and lovers, hear me for my cause, and be silent that you may hear. Believe me for mine honor, and have respect to mine honor that you may believe. Censure me in your wisdom, and awake your senses that you may the better judge. If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of Caesar’s, to him I say that Brutus’ love to Caesar was no less than his. If then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer: not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living, and die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live all freemen? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him. As he was fortunate, I rejoice at it. As he was valiant, I honor him. But, as he was ambitious, I slew him. There is tears for his love, joy for his fortune, honor for his valor, and death for his ambition. Who is here so base that would be a bondman? If any, speak, for him have I offended. Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If any, speak, for him have I offended. Who is here so vile that will not love his country? If any, speak, for him have I offended. I pause for a reply. None, Brutus, none. Then none have I offended. I have done no more to Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question of his death is enrolled in the Capitol, his glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy, nor his offenses enforced for which he suffered death. Enter Mark Antony and others with Caesar’s body. Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony, who, though he had no hand in his death, shall receive the benefit of his dying—a place in the commonwealth—as which of you shall not? With this I depart: that, as I slew my best lover for the good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself when it shall please my country to need my death. Live, Brutus, live, live! Bring him with triumph home unto his house. Give him a statue with his ancestors. Let him be Caesar. Caesar’s better parts Shall be crowned in Brutus. We’ll bring him to his house with shouts and clamors. My countrymen— Peace, silence! Brutus speaks. Peace, ho! Good countrymen, let me depart alone, And, for my sake, stay here with Antony. Do grace to Caesar’s corpse, and grace his speech Tending to Caesar’s glories, which Mark Antony (By our permission) is allowed to make. I do entreat you, not a man depart, Save I alone, till Antony have spoke. He descends and exits. Stay, ho, and let us hear Mark Antony! Let him go up into the public chair. We’ll hear him.—Noble Antony, go up. For Brutus’ sake, I am beholding to you. He goes into the pulpit. What does he say of Brutus? He says for Brutus’ sake He finds himself beholding to us all. ’Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here. This Caesar was a tyrant. Nay, that’s certain. We are blest that Rome is rid of him. Peace, let us hear what Antony can say. You gentle Romans— Peace, ho! Let us hear him. Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears. I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him. The evil that men do lives after them; The good is oft interrèd with their bones. So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus Hath told you Caesar was ambitious. If it were so, it was a grievous fault, And grievously hath Caesar answered it. Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest (For Brutus is an honorable man; So are they all, all honorable men), Come I to speak in Caesar’s funeral. He was my friend, faithful and just to me, But Brutus says he was ambitious, And Brutus is an honorable man. He hath brought many captives home to Rome, Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill. Did this in Caesar seem ambitious? When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept; Ambition should be made of sterner stuff. Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, And Brutus is an honorable man. You all did see that on the Lupercal I thrice presented him a kingly crown, Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, And sure he is an honorable man. I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, But here I am to speak what I do know. You all did love him once, not without cause. What cause withholds you, then, to mourn for him?— O judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar, And I must pause till it come back to me. He weeps. Methinks there is much reason in his sayings. If thou consider rightly of the matter, Caesar has had great wrong. Has he, masters? I fear there will a worse come in his place. Marked you his words? He would not take the crown; Therefore ’tis certain he was not ambitious. If it be found so, some will dear abide it. Poor soul, his eyes are red as fire with weeping. There’s not a nobler man in Rome than Antony. Now mark him. He begins again to speak. But yesterday the word of Caesar might Have stood against the world. Now lies he there, And none so poor to do him reverence. O masters, if I were disposed to stir Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage, I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong, Who, you all know, are honorable men. I will not do them wrong. I rather choose To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you, Than I will wrong such honorable men. But here’s a parchment with the seal of Caesar. I found it in his closet. ’Tis his will. Let but the commons hear this testament, Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read, And they would go and kiss dead Caesar’s wounds And dip their napkins in his sacred blood— Yea, beg a hair of him for memory And, dying, mention it within their wills, Bequeathing it as a rich legacy Unto their issue. We’ll hear the will. Read it, Mark Antony. The will, the will! We will hear Caesar’s will. Have patience, gentle friends. I must not read it. It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you. You are not wood, you are not stones, but men. And, being men, hearing the will of Caesar, It will inflame you; it will make you mad. ’Tis good you know not that you are his heirs, For if you should, O, what would come of it? Read the will! We’ll hear it, Antony. You shall read us the will, Caesar’s will. Will you be patient? Will you stay awhile? I have o’ershot myself to tell you of it. I fear I wrong the honorable men Whose daggers have stabbed Caesar. I do fear it. They were traitors. Honorable men? The will! The testament! They were villains, murderers. The will! Read the will. You will compel me, then, to read the will? Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar, And let me show you him that made the will. Shall I descend? And will you give me leave? Come down. Descend. You shall have leave. Antony descends. A ring; stand round. Stand from the hearse. Stand from the body. Room for Antony, most noble Antony. Nay, press not so upon me. Stand far off. Stand back! Room! Bear back! If you have tears, prepare to shed them now. You all do know this mantle. I remember The first time ever Caesar put it on. ’Twas on a summer’s evening in his tent, That day he overcame the Nervii. Look, in this place ran Cassius’ dagger through. See what a rent the envious Casca made. Through this the well-belovèd Brutus stabbed, And, as he plucked his cursèd steel away, Mark how the blood of Caesar followed it, As rushing out of doors to be resolved If Brutus so unkindly knocked or no; For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar’s angel. Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him! This was the most unkindest cut of all. For when the noble Caesar saw him stab, Ingratitude, more strong than traitors’ arms, Quite vanquished him. Then burst his mighty heart, And, in his mantle muffling up his face, Even at the base of Pompey’s statue (Which all the while ran blood) great Caesar fell. what a fall was there, my countrymen! Then I and you and all of us fell down, Whilst bloody treason flourished over us. now you weep, and I perceive you feel The dint of pity. These are gracious drops. Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold Our Caesar’s vesture wounded? Look you here, Antony lifts Caesar’s cloak. Here is himself, marred as you see with traitors. O piteous spectacle! O noble Caesar! O woeful day! O traitors, villains! O most bloody sight! We will be revenged. Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill! Slay! Let not a traitor live! Stay, countrymen. Peace there! Hear the noble Antony. We’ll hear him, we’ll follow him, we’ll die with him. Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up To such a sudden flood of mutiny. They that have done this deed are honorable. What private griefs they have, alas, I know not, That made them do it. They are wise and honorable And will no doubt with reasons answer you. I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts. I am no orator, as Brutus is, But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man That love my friend, and that they know full well That gave me public leave to speak of him. For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth, Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech To stir men’s blood. I only speak right on. I tell you that which you yourselves do know, Show you sweet Caesar’s wounds, poor poor dumb mouths, And bid them speak for me. But were I Brutus, And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue In every wound of Caesar that should move The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny. We’ll mutiny. We’ll burn the house of Brutus. Away then. Come, seek the conspirators. Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak. Peace, ho! Hear Antony, most noble Antony! Why, friends, you go to do you know not what. Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves? Alas, you know not. I must tell you then. You have forgot the will I told you of. Most true. The will! Let’s stay and hear the will. Here is the will, and under Caesar’s seal: To every Roman citizen he gives, To every several man, seventy-five drachmas. Most noble Caesar! We’ll revenge his death. O royal Caesar! Hear me with patience. Peace, ho! Moreover, he hath left you all his walks, His private arbors, and new-planted orchards, On this side Tiber. He hath left them you, And to your heirs forever—common pleasures To walk abroad and recreate yourselves. Here was a Caesar! When comes such another? Never, never!—Come, away, away! We’ll burn his body in the holy place And with the brands fire the traitors’ houses. Take up the body. Go fetch fire. Pluck down benches. Pluck down forms, windows, anything. Plebeians exit with Caesar’s body. Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot; Take thou what course thou wilt. Enter Servant. How now, fellow? Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome. Where is he? He and Lepidus are at Caesar’s house. And thither will I straight to visit him. He comes upon a wish. Fortune is merry And in this mood will give us anything.

The throng that follows Caesar at the heels, Of senators, of praetors, common suitors, Will crowd a feeble man almost to death. I’ll get me to a place more void, and there Speak to great Caesar as he comes along. He exits. I must go in. Aside. Ay me, how weak a thing The heart of woman is! O Brutus, The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise! Sure the boy heard me. To Lucius. Brutus hath a suit That Caesar will not grant. Aside. O, I grow faint.— Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord. Say I am merry. Come to me again And bring me word what he doth say to thee. They exit separately.",

Think you I am no stronger than my sex, Being so fathered and so husbanded? Tell me your counsels; I will not disclose ’em. I have made strong proof of my constancy, Giving myself a voluntary wound Here, in the thigh. Can I bear that with patience, And not my husband’s secrets? O you gods, Render me worthy of this noble wife! Knock. Hark, hark, one knocks. Portia, go in awhile, And by and by thy bosom shall partake The secrets of my heart.

No, my Brutus, You have some sick offense within your mind, Which by the right and virtue of my place I ought to know of. She kneels. And upon my knees I charm you, by my once commended beauty, By all your vows of love, and that great vow Which did incorporate and make us one, That you unfold to me, your self, your half, Why you are heavy, and what men tonight Have had resort to you; for here have been Some six or seven who did hide their faces Even from darkness. Kneel not, gentle Portia. He lifts her up. I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus. Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus, Is it excepted I should know no secrets That appertain to you? Am I your self But, as it were, in sort or limitation, To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed, And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbs Of your good pleasure? If it be no more, Portia is Brutus’ harlot, not his wife. You are my true and honorable wife, As dear to me as are the ruddy drops That visit my sad heart.

      "Enter Brutus and Cassius with the Plebeians. We will be satisfied! Let us be satisfied! Then follow me and give me audience, friends.— Cassius, go you into the other street And part the numbers.— Those that will hear me speak, let ’em stay here; Those that will follow Cassius, go with him; And public reasons shall be renderèd Of Caesar’s death. I will hear Brutus speak. I will hear Cassius, and compare their reasons When severally we hear them renderèd. Cassius exits with some of the Plebeians. Brutus goes into the pulpit. The noble Brutus is ascended. Silence. Be patient till the last. Romans, countrymen, and lovers, hear me for my cause, and be silent that you may hear. Believe me for mine honor, and have respect to mine honor that you may believe. Censure me in your wisdom, and awake your senses that you may the better judge. If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of Caesar’s, to him I say that Brutus’ love to Caesar was no less than his. If then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer: not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living, and die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live all freemen? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him. As he was fortunate, I rejoice at it. As he was valiant, I honor him. But, as he was ambitious, I slew him. There is tears for his love, joy for his fortune, honor for his valor, and death for his ambition. Who is here so base that would be a bondman? If any, speak, for him have I offended. Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If any, speak, for him have I offended. Who is here so vile that will not love his country? If any, speak, for him have I offended. I pause for a reply. None, Brutus, none. Then none have I offended. I have done no more to Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question of his death is enrolled in the Capitol, his glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy, nor his offenses enforced for which he suffered death. Enter Mark Antony and others with Caesar’s body. Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony, who, though he had no hand in his death, shall receive the benefit of his dying—a place in the commonwealth—as which of you shall not? With this I depart: that, as I slew my best lover for the good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself when it shall please my country to need my death. Live, Brutus, live, live! Bring him with triumph home unto his house. Give him a statue with his ancestors. Let him be Caesar. Caesar’s better parts Shall be crowned in Brutus. We’ll bring him to his house with shouts and clamors. My countrymen— Peace, silence! Brutus speaks. Peace, ho! Good countrymen, let me depart alone, And, for my sake, stay here with Antony. Do grace to Caesar’s corpse, and grace his speech Tending to Caesar’s glories, which Mark Antony (By our permission) is allowed to make. I do entreat you, not a man depart, Save I alone, till Antony have spoke. He descends and exits. Stay, ho, and let us hear Mark Antony! Let him go up into the public chair. We’ll hear him.—Noble Antony, go up. For Brutus’ sake, I am beholding to you. He goes into the pulpit. What does he say of Brutus? He says for Brutus’ sake He finds himself beholding to us all. ’Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here. This Caesar was a tyrant. Nay, that’s certain. We are blest that Rome is rid of him. Peace, let us hear what Antony can say. You gentle Romans— Peace, ho! Let us hear him. Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears. I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him. The evil that men do lives after them; The good is oft interrèd with their bones. So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus Hath told you Caesar was ambitious. If it were so, it was a grievous fault, And grievously hath Caesar answered it. Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest (For Brutus is an honorable man; So are they all, all honorable men), Come I to speak in Caesar’s funeral. He was my friend, faithful and just to me, But Brutus says he was ambitious, And Brutus is an honorable man. He hath brought many captives home to Rome, Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill. Did this in Caesar seem ambitious? When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept; Ambition should be made of sterner stuff. Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, And Brutus is an honorable man. You all did see that on the Lupercal I thrice presented him a kingly crown, Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, And sure he is an honorable man. I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, But here I am to speak what I do know. You all did love him once, not without cause. What cause withholds you, then, to mourn for him?— O judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar, And I must pause till it come back to me. He weeps. Methinks there is much reason in his sayings. If thou consider rightly of the matter, Caesar has had great wrong. Has he, masters? I fear there will a worse come in his place. Marked you his words? He would not take the crown; Therefore ’tis certain he was not ambitious. If it be found so, some will dear abide it. Poor soul, his eyes are red as fire with weeping. There’s not a nobler man in Rome than Antony. Now mark him. He begins again to speak. But yesterday the word of Caesar might Have stood against the world. Now lies he there, And none so poor to do him reverence. O masters, if I were disposed to stir Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage, I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong, Who, you all know, are honorable men. I will not do them wrong. I rather choose To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you, Than I will wrong such honorable men. But here’s a parchment with the seal of Caesar. I found it in his closet. ’Tis his will. Let but the commons hear this testament, Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read, And they would go and kiss dead Caesar’s wounds And dip their napkins in his sacred blood— Yea, beg a hair of him for memory And, dying, mention it within their wills, Bequeathing it as a rich legacy Unto their issue. We’ll hear the will. Read it, Mark Antony. The will, the will! We will hear Caesar’s will. Have patience, gentle friends. I must not read it. It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you. You are not wood, you are not stones, but men. And, being men, hearing the will of Caesar, It will inflame you; it will make you mad. ’Tis good you know not that you are his heirs, For if you should, O, what would come of it? Read the will! We’ll hear it, Antony. You shall read us the will, Caesar’s will. Will you be patient? Will you stay awhile? I have o’ershot myself to tell you of it. I fear I wrong the honorable men Whose daggers have stabbed Caesar. I do fear it. They were traitors. Honorable men? The will! The testament! They were villains, murderers. The will! Read the will. You will compel me, then, to read the will? Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar, And let me show you him that made the will. Shall I descend? And will you give me leave? Come down. Descend. You shall have leave. Antony descends. A ring; stand round. Stand from the hearse. Stand from the body. Room for Antony, most noble Antony. Nay, press not so upon me. Stand far off. Stand back! Room! Bear back! If you have tears, prepare to shed them now. You all do know this mantle. I remember The first time ever Caesar put it on. ’Twas on a summer’s evening in his tent, That day he overcame the Nervii. Look, in this place ran Cassius’ dagger through. See what a rent the envious Casca made. Through this the well-belovèd Brutus stabbed, And, as he plucked his cursèd steel away, Mark how the blood of Caesar followed it, As rushing out of doors to be resolved If Brutus so unkindly knocked or no; For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar’s angel. Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him! This was the most unkindest cut of all. For when the noble Caesar saw him stab, Ingratitude, more strong than traitors’ arms, Quite vanquished him. Then burst his mighty heart, And, in his mantle muffling up his face, Even at the base of Pompey’s statue (Which all the while ran blood) great Caesar fell. what a fall was there, my countrymen! Then I and you and all of us fell down, Whilst bloody treason flourished over us. now you weep, and I perceive you feel The dint of pity. These are gracious drops. Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold Our Caesar’s vesture wounded? Look you here, Antony lifts Caesar’s cloak. Here is himself, marred as you see with traitors. O piteous spectacle! O noble Caesar! O woeful day! O traitors, villains! O most bloody sight! We will be revenged. Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill! Slay! Let not a traitor live! Stay, countrymen. Peace there! Hear the noble Antony. We’ll hear him, we’ll follow him, we’ll die with him. Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up To such a sudden flood of mutiny. They that have done this deed are honorable. What private griefs they have, alas, I know not, That made them do it. They are wise and honorable And will no doubt with reasons answer you. I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts. I am no orator, as Brutus is, But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man That love my friend, and that they know full well That gave me public leave to speak of him. For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth, Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech To stir men’s blood. I only speak right on. I tell you that which you yourselves do know, Show you sweet Caesar’s wounds, poor poor dumb mouths, And bid them speak for me. But were I Brutus, And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue In every wound of Caesar that should move The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny. We’ll mutiny. We’ll burn the house of Brutus. Away then. Come, seek the conspirators. Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak. Peace, ho! Hear Antony, most noble Antony! Why, friends, you go to do you know not what. Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves? Alas, you know not. I must tell you then. You have forgot the will I told you of. Most true. The will! Let’s stay and hear the will. Here is the will, and under Caesar’s seal: To every Roman citizen he gives, To every several man, seventy-five drachmas. Most noble Caesar! We’ll revenge his death. O royal Caesar! Hear me with patience. Peace, ho! Moreover, he hath left you all his walks, His private arbors, and new-planted orchards, On this side Tiber. He hath left them you, And to your heirs forever—common pleasures To walk abroad and recreate yourselves. Here was a Caesar! When comes such another? Never, never!—Come, away, away! We’ll burn his body in the holy place And with the brands fire the traitors’ houses. Take up the body. Go fetch fire. Pluck down benches. Pluck down forms, windows, anything. Plebeians exit with Caesar’s body. Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot; Take thou what course thou wilt. Enter Servant. How now, fellow? Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome. Where is he? He and Lepidus are at Caesar’s house. And thither will I straight to visit him. He comes upon a wish. Fortune is merry And in this mood will give us anything. I heard him say Brutus and Cassius Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome. Belike they had some notice of the people How I had moved them. Bring me to Octavius. They exit.",

Security gives way to conspiracy. The mighty gods defend thee! Thy lover, Artemidorus Here will I stand till Caesar pass along, And as a suitor will I give him this. My heart laments that virtue cannot live Out of the teeth of emulation. If thou read this, O Caesar, thou mayest live; If not, the Fates with traitors do contrive. He exits.",

The arrival of the letter and the conspirators intensifies his internal conflict, pushing him toward action despite his reservations. Brutus's struggle is further complicated by Portia's plea for his trust, highlighting the tension between his public duty and private life. Finally, Ligarius's arrival and immediate willingness to follow Brutus underscores Brutus's influence and the momentum of the conspiracy, setting the stage for the assassination.",
      "Brutus attempts to justify Caesar's assassination by appealing to the plebeians' patriotism and fear of tyranny, prioritizing the good of Rome over personal loyalty. His appeal to reason and honor, however, is undermined by Antony's emotional manipulation, which stirs the crowd to mutiny by highlighting Caesar's virtues and their personal loss. Antony's calculated use of rhetoric, feigning reluctance while skillfully revealing Caesar's will and displaying his wounds, incites the plebeians to seek revenge, demonstrating the power of emotional appeals over rational arguments in swaying public opinion. The scene culminates in the complete reversal of public sentiment, setting the stage for further conflict and chaos as Antony seizes the opportunity to consolidate power.",

      "Enter Caesar, Antony for the course, Calphurnia, Portia, Decius, Cicero, Brutus, Cassius, Casca, a Soothsayer; after them Marullus and Flavius and Commoners. Calphurnia. Peace, ho! Caesar speaks. Calphurnia. Here, my lord. Stand you directly in Antonius’ way When he doth run his course.—Antonius. Caesar, my lord. Forget not in your speed, Antonius, To touch Calphurnia, for our elders say The barren, touchèd in this holy chase, Shake off their sterile curse. I shall remember. When Caesar says “Do this,” it is performed. Set on and leave no ceremony out. Sennet. Caesar. Ha! Who calls? Bid every noise be still. Peace, yet again! Who is it in the press that calls on me? I hear a tongue shriller than all the music Cry “Caesar.” Speak. Caesar is turned to hear. Beware the ides of March. What man is that? A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March. Set him before me. Let me see his face. Fellow, come from the throng. The Soothsayer comes forward. Look upon Caesar. What sayst thou to me now? Speak once again. Beware the ides of March. He is a dreamer. Let us leave him. Pass. Sennet. All but Brutus and Cassius exit. Will you go see the order of the course? Not I. I pray you, do. I am not gamesome. I do lack some part Of that quick spirit that is in Antony. Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires. I’ll leave you. Brutus, I do observe you now of late. I have not from your eyes that gentleness And show of love as I was wont to have. You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand Over your friend that loves you. Cassius, Be not deceived. If I have veiled my look, I turn the trouble of my countenance Merely upon myself. Vexèd I am Of late with passions of some difference, Conceptions only proper to myself, Which give some soil, perhaps, to my behaviors. But let not therefore my good friends be grieved (Among which number, Cassius, be you one) Nor construe any further my neglect Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war, Forgets the shows of love to other men. Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion, By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations. Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face? No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself But by reflection, by some other things. ’Tis just. And it is very much lamented, Brutus, That you have no such mirrors as will turn Your hidden worthiness into your eye, That you might see your shadow. I have heard Where many of the best respect in Rome, Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus And groaning underneath this age’s yoke, Have wished that noble Brutus had his eyes. Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius, That you would have me seek into myself For that which is not in me? Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear. And since you know you cannot see yourself So well as by reflection, I, your glass, Will modestly discover to yourself That of yourself which you yet know not of. And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus. Were I a common laughter, or did use To stale with ordinary oaths my love To every new protester; if you know That I do fawn on men and hug them hard And after scandal them, or if you know That I profess myself in banqueting To all the rout, then hold me dangerous. Flourish and shout. What means this shouting? I do fear the people Choose Caesar for their king. Ay, do you fear it? Then must I think you would not have it so. I would not, Cassius, yet I love him well. But wherefore do you hold me here so long? What is it that you would impart to me? If it be aught toward the general good, Set honor in one eye and death i’ th’ other And I will look on both indifferently; For let the gods so speed me as I love The name of honor more than I fear death. I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus, As well as I do know your outward favor. Well, honor is the subject of my story. I cannot tell what you and other men Think of this life; but, for my single self, I had as lief not be as live to be In awe of such a thing as I myself. I was born free as Caesar; so were you; We both have fed as well, and we can both Endure the winter’s cold as well as he. For once, upon a raw and gusty day, The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores, Caesar said to me “Dar’st thou, Cassius, now Leap in with me into this angry flood And swim to yonder point?” Upon the word, Accoutered as I was, I plungèd in And bade him follow; so indeed he did. The torrent roared, and we did buffet it With lusty sinews, throwing it aside And stemming it with hearts of controversy. But ere we could arrive the point proposed, Caesar cried “Help me, Cassius, or I sink!” as Aeneas, our great ancestor, Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber Did I the tired Caesar. And this man Is now become a god, and Cassius is A wretched creature and must bend his body If Caesar carelessly but nod on him. He had a fever when he was in Spain, And when the fit was on him, I did mark How he did shake. ’Tis true, this god did shake. His coward lips did from their color fly, And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world Did lose his luster. I did hear him groan. Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans Mark him and write his speeches in their books, “Alas,” it cried “Give me some drink, Titinius” As a sick girl. You gods, it doth amaze me A man of such a feeble temper should So get the start of the majestic world And bear the palm alone. Shout. Flourish. Another general shout! I do believe that these applauses are For some new honors that are heaped on Caesar. Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world Like a Colossus, and we petty men Walk under his huge legs and peep about To find ourselves dishonorable graves. Men at some time are masters of their fates. The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, But in ourselves, that we are underlings. “Brutus” and “Caesar”—what should be in that “Caesar”? Why should that name be sounded more than yours? Write them together, yours is as fair a name; Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well; Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with ’em, “Brutus” will start a spirit as soon as “Caesar.” Now, in the names of all the gods at once, Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed! Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods! When went there by an age, since the great flood, But it was famed with more than with one man? When could they say, till now, that talked of Rome, That her wide walks encompassed but one man? Now is it Rome indeed, and room enough When there is in it but one only man. you and I have heard our fathers say There was a Brutus once that would have brooked Th’ eternal devil to keep his state in Rome As easily as a king. That you do love me, I am nothing jealous. What you would work me to, I have some aim. How I have thought of this, and of these times, I shall recount hereafter. For this present, I would not, so with love I might entreat you, Be any further moved. What you have said I will consider; what you have to say I will with patience hear, and find a time Both meet to hear and answer such high things. Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this: Brutus had rather be a villager Than to repute himself a son of Rome Under these hard conditions as this time Is like to lay upon us. I am glad that my weak words Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus. Enter Caesar and his train. The games are done, and Caesar is returning. As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve, And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you What hath proceeded worthy note today. I will do so. But look you, Cassius, The angry spot doth glow on Caesar’s brow, And all the rest look like a chidden train. Calphurnia’s cheek is pale, and Cicero Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes As we have seen him in the Capitol, Being crossed in conference by some senators. Casca will tell us what the matter is. Antonius. Caesar. Let me have men about me that are fat, Sleek-headed men, and such as sleep a-nights. Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look. He thinks too much. Such men are dangerous. Fear him not, Caesar; he’s not dangerous. He is a noble Roman, and well given. Would he were fatter! But I fear him not. Yet if my name were liable to fear, I do not know the man I should avoid So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much, He is a great observer, and he looks Quite through the deeds of men. He loves no plays, As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music; Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort As if he mocked himself and scorned his spirit That could be moved to smile at anything. Such men as he be never at heart’s ease Whiles they behold a greater than themselves, And therefore are they very dangerous. I rather tell thee what is to be feared Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar. Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf, And tell me truly what thou think’st of him. Sennet. Caesar and his train exit but Casca remains behind. You pulled me by the cloak. Would you speak with me? Ay, Casca. Tell us what hath chanced today That Caesar looks so sad. Why, you were with him, were you not? I should not then ask Casca what had chanced. Why, there was a crown offered him; and, being offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand, thus, and then the people fell a-shouting. What was the second noise for? Why, for that too. They shouted thrice. What was the last cry for? Why, for that too. Was the crown offered him thrice? Ay, marry, was ’t, and he put it by thrice, every time gentler than other; and at every putting-by, mine honest neighbors shouted. Who offered him the crown? Why, Antony. Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca. I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it. It was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown (yet ’twas not a crown neither; ’twas one of these coronets), and, as I told you, he put it by once; but for all that, to my thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he offered it to him again; then he put it by again; but to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it. And then he offered it the third time. He put it the third time by, and still as he refused it the rabblement hooted and clapped their chopped hands and threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked Caesar, for he swooned and fell down at it. And for mine own part, I durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air. But soft, I pray you. What, did Caesar swoon? He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and was speechless. ’Tis very like; he hath the falling sickness. No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness. I know not what you mean by that, but I am sure Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and displeased them, as they use to do the players in the theater, I am no true man. What said he when he came unto himself? Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common herd was glad he refused the crown, he plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his throat to cut. An I had been a man of any occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word, I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so he fell. When he came to himself again, he said if he had done or said anything amiss, he desired their Worships to think it was his infirmity. Three or four wenches where I stood cried “Alas, good soul!” and forgave him with all their hearts. But there’s no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less. And, after that, he came thus sad away? Ay. Did Cicero say anything? Ay, he spoke Greek. To what effect? Nay, an I tell you that, I’ll ne’er look you i’ th’ face again. But those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads. But for mine own part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarves off Caesar’s images, are put to silence. Fare you well. There was more foolery yet, if I could remember it. Will you sup with me tonight, Casca? No, I am promised forth. Will you dine with me tomorrow? Ay, if I be alive, and your mind hold, and your dinner worth the eating. Good. I will expect you. Do so. Farewell both. He exits. What a blunt fellow is this grown to be! He was quick mettle when he went to school. So is he now in execution Of any bold or noble enterprise, However he puts on this tardy form. This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit, Which gives men stomach to digest his words With better appetite. And so it is. For this time I will leave you. Tomorrow, if you please to speak with me, I will come home to you; or, if you will, Come home to me, and I will wait for you. I will do so. Till then, think of the world. Brutus exits. Well, Brutus, thou art noble. Yet I see Thy honorable mettle may be wrought From that it is disposed. Therefore it is meet That noble minds keep ever with their likes; For who so firm that cannot be seduced? Caesar doth bear me hard, but he loves Brutus. If I were Brutus now, and he were Cassius, He should not humor me. I will this night In several hands in at his windows throw, As if they came from several citizens, Writings, all tending to the great opinion That Rome holds of his name, wherein obscurely Caesar’s ambition shall be glancèd at And after this, let Caesar seat him sure, For we will shake him, or worse days endure. He exits.",

The ides of March are come. SOOTHSAYER Ay, Caesar, but not gone. ARTEMIDORUS Hail, Caesar. Read this schedule. Trebonius doth desire you to o’erread, At your best leisure, this his humble suit. O Caesar, read mine first, for mine’s a suit That touches Caesar nearer. Read it, great Caesar. What touches us ourself shall be last served. Delay not, Caesar; read it instantly. What, is the fellow mad? Sirrah, give place. What, urge you your petitions in the street? Come to the Capitol. Caesar goes forward, the rest following. to Cassius I wish your enterprise today may thrive. What enterprise, Popilius? Fare you well. He walks away. What said Popilius Lena? He wished today our enterprise might thrive. I fear our purpose is discoverèd. Look how he makes to Caesar. Mark him. Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention.— Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known, Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back, For I will slay myself. Cassius, be constant. Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes, For look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change. Trebonius knows his time, for look you, Brutus, He draws Mark Antony out of the way. Trebonius and Antony exit. Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him go And presently prefer his suit to Caesar. He is addressed. Press near and second him. Casca, you are the first that rears your hand. Are we all ready? What is now amiss That Caesar and his Senate must redress? kneeling Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar, Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat An humble heart. I must prevent thee, Cimber. These couchings and these lowly courtesies Might fire the blood of ordinary men And turn preordinance and first decree Into the law of children. Be not fond To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood That will be thawed from the true quality With that which melteth fools—I mean sweet words, Low-crookèd curtsies, and base spaniel fawning. Thy brother by decree is banishèd. If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him, I spurn thee like a cur out of my way. Know: Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause Will he be satisfied. Is there no voice more worthy than my own To sound more sweetly in great Caesar’s ear For the repealing of my banished brother? kneeling I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar, Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may Have an immediate freedom of repeal. What, Brutus? kneeling Pardon, Caesar; Caesar, pardon! As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber. I could be well moved, if I were as you. If I could pray to move, prayers would move me. But I am constant as the Northern Star, Of whose true fixed and resting quality There is no fellow in the firmament. The skies are painted with unnumbered sparks; They are all fire, and every one doth shine. But there’s but one in all doth hold his place. So in the world: ’tis furnished well with men, And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive. Yet in the number I do know but one That unassailable holds on his rank, Unshaked of motion; and that I am he Let me a little show it, even in this: That I was constant Cimber should be banished And constant do remain to keep him so. kneeling O Caesar— Hence. Wilt thou lift up Olympus? kneeling Great Caesar— Doth not Brutus bootless kneel? Speak, hands, for me! As Casca strikes, the others rise up and stab Caesar. Et tu, Brutè?—Then fall, Caesar. He dies. Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead! Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets. Some to the common pulpits and cry out “Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement.” People and Senators, be not affrighted. Fly not; stand still. Ambition’s debt is paid. Go to the pulpit, Brutus. And Cassius too. Where’s Publius? Here, quite confounded with this mutiny. Stand fast together, lest some friend of Caesar’s Should chance— Talk not of standing.—Publius, good cheer. There is no harm intended to your person, Nor to no Roman else. So tell them, Publius. And leave us, Publius, lest that the people, Rushing on us, should do your age some mischief. Do so, and let no man abide this deed But we the doers. All but the Conspirators exit. Enter Trebonius. Where is Antony? TREBONIUS Fled to his house amazed. Men, wives, and children stare, cry out, and run As it were doomsday. BRUTUS Fates, we will know your pleasures. That we shall die we know; ’tis but the time, And drawing days out, that men stand upon. Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life Cuts off so many years of fearing death. Grant that, and then is death a benefit. So are we Caesar’s friends, that have abridged His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop, And let us bathe our hands in Caesar’s blood Up to the elbows and besmear our swords. Then walk we forth, even to the marketplace, And, waving our red weapons o’er our heads, Let’s all cry “Peace, freedom, and liberty!” Stoop then, and wash. They smear their hands and swords with Caesar’s blood. How many ages hence Shall this our lofty scene be acted over In states unborn and accents yet unknown! How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport, That now on Pompey’s basis lies along No worthier than the dust! So oft as that shall be, So often shall the knot of us be called The men that gave their country liberty. What, shall we forth? Ay, every man away. Brutus shall lead, and we will grace his heels With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome. Enter a Servant. Soft, who comes here? A friend of Antony’s. kneeling Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel. Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down, And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say: Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest; Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving. Say, I love Brutus, and I honor him; Say, I feared Caesar, honored him, and loved him. If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony May safely come to him and be resolved How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death, Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead So well as Brutus living, but will follow The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus Thorough the hazards of this untrod state With all true faith. So says my master Antony. Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman. I never thought him worse. Tell him, so please him come unto this place, He shall be satisfied and, by my honor, Depart untouched. I’ll fetch him presently. Servant exits. I know that we shall have him well to friend. I wish we may; but yet have I a mind That fears him much, and my misgiving still Falls shrewdly to the purpose. Enter Antony. But here comes Antony.—Welcome, Mark Antony! O mighty Caesar, dost thou lie so low? Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.— I know not, gentlemen, what you intend, Who else must be let blood, who else is rank. If I myself, there is no hour so fit As Caesar’s death’s hour, nor no instrument Of half that worth as those your swords made rich With the most noble blood of all this world. I do beseech you, if you bear me hard, Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke, Fulfill your pleasure. Live a thousand years, I shall not find myself so apt to die; No place will please me so, no mean of death, As here by Caesar, and by you cut off, The choice and master spirits of this age. O Antony, beg not your death of us! Though now we must appear bloody and cruel, As by our hands and this our present act You see we do, yet see you but our hands And this the bleeding business they have done. Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful; And pity to the general wrong of Rome (As fire drives out fire, so pity pity) Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part, To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony. Our arms in strength of malice, and our hearts Of brothers’ temper, do receive you in With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence. Your voice shall be as strong as any man’s In the disposing of new dignities. Only be patient till we have appeased The multitude, beside themselves with fear; And then we will deliver you the cause Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him, Have thus proceeded. I doubt not of your wisdom. Let each man render me his bloody hand. First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you.— Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand.— Now, Decius Brutus, yours;—now yours, Metellus;— Yours, Cinna;—and, my valiant Casca, yours;— Though last, not least in love, yours, good Trebonius.— Gentlemen all—alas, what shall I say? My credit now stands on such slippery ground That one of two bad ways you must conceit me, Either a coward or a flatterer.— That I did love thee, Caesar, O, ’tis true! If then thy spirit look upon us now, Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death To see thy Antony making his peace, Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes— Most noble!—in the presence of thy corpse? Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds, Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood, It would become me better than to close In terms of friendship with thine enemies. Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bayed, brave hart, Here didst thou fall, and here thy hunters stand Signed in thy spoil and crimsoned in thy Lethe. O world, thou wast the forest to this hart, And this indeed, O world, the heart of thee. How like a deer strucken by many princes Dost thou here lie! Mark Antony— Pardon me, Caius Cassius. The enemies of Caesar shall say this; Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty. I blame you not for praising Caesar so. But what compact mean you to have with us? Will you be pricked in number of our friends, Or shall we on and not depend on you? Therefore I took your hands, but was indeed Swayed from the point by looking down on Caesar. Friends am I with you all and love you all, Upon this hope, that you shall give me reasons Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous. Or else were this a savage spectacle. Our reasons are so full of good regard That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar, You should be satisfied. That’s all I seek; And am, moreover, suitor that I may Produce his body to the marketplace, And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend, Speak in the order of his funeral. You shall, Mark Antony. Brutus, a word with you. Aside to Brutus. You know not what you do. Do not consent That Antony speak in his funeral. Know you how much the people may be moved By that which he will utter? aside to Cassius By your pardon, I will myself into the pulpit first And show the reason of our Caesar’s death. What Antony shall speak I will protest He speaks by leave and by permission, And that we are contented Caesar shall Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies. It shall advantage more than do us wrong. aside to Brutus I know not what may fall. I like it not. Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar’s body. You shall not in your funeral speech blame us But speak all good you can devise of Caesar And say you do ’t by our permission, Else shall you not have any hand at all About his funeral. And you shall speak In the same pulpit whereto I am going, After my speech is ended. Be it so. I do desire no more. Prepare the body, then, and follow us. All but Antony exit. O pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth, That I am meek and gentle with these butchers. Thou art the ruins of the noblest man That ever livèd in the tide of times. Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood! Over thy wounds now do I prophesy (Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue) A curse shall light upon the limbs of men; Domestic fury and fierce civil strife Shall cumber all the parts of Italy; Blood and destruction shall be so in use And dreadful objects so familiar That mothers shall but smile when they behold Their infants quartered with the hands of war, All pity choked with custom of fell deeds; And Caesar’s spirit, ranging for revenge, With Ate by his side come hot from hell, Shall in these confines with a monarch’s voice Cry “Havoc!” and let slip the dogs of war, That this foul deed shall smell above the earth With carrion men groaning for burial. Enter Octavius’ Servant. You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not? do, Mark Antony. Caesar did write for him to come to Rome. He did receive his letters and is coming, And bid me say to you by word of mouth— O Caesar! Thy heart is big. Get thee apart and weep. Passion, I see, is catching, for mine eyes, Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine, Began to water. Is thy master coming? He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome. Post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced. Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome, No Rome of safety for Octavius yet. Hie hence and tell him so.—Yet stay awhile; Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corpse Into the marketplace. There shall I try, In my oration, how the people take The cruel issue of these bloody men, According to the which thou shalt discourse To young Octavius of the state of things. Lend me your hand.

Ay, and briefly. Ay, and wisely. Ay, and truly, you were best. What is my name? Whither am I going? Where do I dwell? Am I a married man or a bachelor? Then to answer every man directly and briefly, wisely and truly: wisely I say, I am a bachelor. That’s as much as to say they are fools that marry. You’ll bear me a bang for that, I fear.

Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you. Do so, good Messala. How died my master, Strato? I held the sword, and he did run on it. Octavius, then take him to follow thee, That did the latest service to my master. This was the noblest Roman of them all. All the conspirators save only he Did that they did in envy of great Caesar.

You may do your will, But he’s a tried and valiant soldier. So is my horse, Octavius, and for that I do appoint him store of provender. It is a creature that I teach to fight, To wind, to stop, to run directly on, His corporal motion governed by my spirit; And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so. He must be taught and trained and bid go forth— A barren-spirited fellow, one that feeds On objects, arts, and imitations Which, out of use and staled by other men, Begin his fashion.

If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of Caesar’s, to him I say that Brutus’ love to Caesar was no less than his. If then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer: not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living, and die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live all freemen? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him. As he was fortunate, I rejoice at it. As he was valiant, I honor him. But, as he was ambitious, I slew him. There is tears for his love, joy for his fortune, honor for his valor, and death for his ambition. Who is here so base that would be a bondman? If any, speak, for him have I offended. Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If any, speak, for him have I offended. Who is here so vile that will not love his country? If any, speak, for him have I offended. I pause for a reply. None, Brutus, none. Then none have I offended.

I do entreat you, not a man depart, Save I alone, till Antony have spoke. He descends and exits. Stay, ho, and let us hear Mark Antony! Let him go up into the public chair.

Peace, let us hear what Antony can say. You gentle Romans— Peace, ho! Let us hear him. Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears. I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him. The evil that men do lives after them; The good is oft interrèd with their bones. So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus Hath told you Caesar was ambitious. If it were so, it was a grievous fault, And grievously hath Caesar answered it. Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest (For Brutus is an honorable man; So are they all, all honorable men), Come I to speak in Caesar’s funeral. He was my friend, faithful and just to me, But Brutus says he was ambitious, And Brutus is an honorable man. He hath brought many captives home to Rome, Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill. Did this in Caesar seem ambitious? When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept; Ambition should be made of sterner stuff. Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, And Brutus is an honorable man. You all did see that on the Lupercal I thrice presented him a kingly crown, Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, And sure he is an honorable man. I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, But here I am to speak what I do know. You all did love him once, not without cause. What cause withholds you, then, to mourn for him?— O judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar, And I must pause till it come back to me. He weeps. Methinks there is much reason in his sayings. If thou consider rightly of the matter, Caesar has had great wrong. Has he, masters? I fear there will a worse come in his place. Marked you his words? He would not take the crown; Therefore ’tis certain he was not ambitious. If it be found so, some will dear abide it. Poor soul, his eyes are red as fire with weeping. There’s not a nobler man in Rome than Antony. Now mark him. He begins again to speak. But yesterday the word of Caesar might Have stood against the world. Now lies he there, And none so poor to do him reverence. O masters, if I were disposed to stir Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage, I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong, Who, you all know, are honorable men. I will not do them wrong. I rather choose To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you, Than I will wrong such honorable men. But here’s a parchment with the seal of Caesar. I found it in his closet. ’Tis his will. Let but the commons hear this testament, Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read, And they would go and kiss dead Caesar’s wounds And dip their napkins in his sacred blood— Yea, beg a hair of him for memory And, dying, mention it within their wills, Bequeathing it as a rich legacy Unto their issue. We’ll hear the will. Read it, Mark Antony. The will, the will! We will hear Caesar’s will. Have patience, gentle friends. I must not read it. It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you. You are not wood, you are not stones, but men. And, being men, hearing the will of Caesar, It will inflame you; it will make you mad. ’Tis good you know not that you are his heirs, For if you should, O, what would come of it? Read the will! We’ll hear it, Antony. You shall read us the will, Caesar’s will. Will you be patient? Will you stay awhile? I have o’ershot myself to tell you of it. I fear I wrong the honorable men Whose daggers have stabbed Caesar. I do fear it. They were traitors. Honorable men? The will! The testament! They were villains, murderers. The will! Read the will. You will compel me, then, to read the will? Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar, And let me show you him that made the will. Shall I descend? And will you give me leave? Come down. Descend. You shall have leave. Antony descends. A ring; stand round. Stand from the hearse. Stand from the body. Room for Antony, most noble Antony. Nay, press not so upon me. Stand far off. Stand back! Room! Bear back! If you have tears, prepare to shed them now. You all do know this mantle. I remember The first time ever Caesar put it on. ’Twas on a summer’s evening in his tent, That day he overcame the Nervii. Look, in this place ran Cassius’ dagger through. See what a rent the envious Casca made. Through this the well-belovèd Brutus stabbed, And, as he plucked his cursèd steel away, Mark how the blood of Caesar followed it, As rushing out of doors to be resolved If Brutus so unkindly knocked or no; For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar’s angel. Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him! This was the most unkindest cut of all. For when the noble Caesar saw him stab, Ingratitude, more strong than traitors’ arms, Quite vanquished him. Then burst his mighty heart, And, in his mantle muffling up his face, Even at the base of Pompey’s statue (Which all the while ran blood) great Caesar fell. what a fall was there, my countrymen! Then I and you and all of us fell down, Whilst bloody treason flourished over us. now you weep, and I perceive you feel The dint of pity. These are gracious drops. Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold Our Caesar’s vesture wounded? Look you here, Antony lifts Caesar’s cloak. Here is himself, marred as you see with traitors. O piteous spectacle! O noble Caesar! O woeful day! O traitors, villains! O most bloody sight! We will be revenged. Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill! Slay! Let not a traitor live! Stay, countrymen. Peace there! Hear the noble Antony. We’ll hear him, we’ll follow him, we’ll die with him. Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up To such a sudden flood of mutiny. They that have done this deed are honorable. What private griefs they have, alas, I know not, That made them do it. They are wise and honorable And will no doubt with reasons answer you. I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts. I am no orator, as Brutus is, But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man That love my friend, and that they know full well That gave me public leave to speak of him. For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth, Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech To stir men’s blood. I only speak right on. I tell you that which you yourselves do know, Show you sweet Caesar’s wounds, poor poor dumb mouths, And bid them speak for me. But were I Brutus, And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue In every wound of Caesar that should move The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny. We’ll mutiny. We’ll burn the house of Brutus. Away then. Come, seek the conspirators. Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak. Peace, ho! Hear Antony, most noble Antony! Why, friends, you go to do you know not what. Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves? Alas, you know not. I must tell you then. You have forgot the will I told you of. Most true. The will! Let’s stay and hear the will. Here is the will, and under Caesar’s seal: To every Roman citizen he gives, To every several man, seventy-five drachmas. Most noble Caesar! We’ll revenge his death. O royal Caesar! Hear me with patience. Peace, ho! Moreover, he hath left you all his walks, His private arbors, and new-planted orchards, On this side Tiber. He hath left them you, And to your heirs forever—common pleasures To walk abroad and recreate yourselves. Here was a Caesar! When comes such another? Never, never!—Come, away, away! We’ll burn his body in the holy place And with the brands fire the traitors’ houses. Take up the body. Go fetch fire. Pluck down benches. Pluck down forms, windows, anything. Plebeians exit with Caesar’s body. Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot; Take thou what course thou wilt. Enter Servant. How now, fellow? Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome. Where is he?

They that have done this deed are honorable. What private griefs they have, alas, I know not, That made them do it. They are wise and honorable And will no doubt with reasons answer you. I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts. I am no orator, as Brutus is, But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man That love my friend, and that they know full well That gave me public leave to speak of him. For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth, Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech To stir men’s blood. I only speak right on. I tell you that which you yourselves do know, Show you sweet Caesar’s wounds, poor poor dumb mouths, And bid them speak for me. But were I Brutus, And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue In every wound of Caesar that should move The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny. We’ll mutiny. We’ll burn the house of Brutus. Away then. Come, seek the conspirators. Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak. Peace, ho! Hear Antony, most noble Antony! Why, friends, you go to do you know not what. Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves? Alas, you know not. I must tell you then. You have forgot the will I told you of. Most true. The will! Let’s stay and hear the will. Here is the will, and under Caesar’s seal: To every Roman citizen he gives, To every several man, seventy-five drachmas. Most noble Caesar! We’ll revenge his death. O royal Caesar! Hear me with patience. Peace, ho! Moreover, he hath left you all his walks, His private arbors, and new-planted orchards, On this side Tiber. He hath left them you, And to your heirs forever—common pleasures To walk abroad and recreate yourselves. Here was a Caesar! When comes such another? Never, never!—Come, away, away! We’ll burn his body in the holy place And with the brands fire the traitors’ houses. Take up the body. Go fetch fire. Pluck down benches. Pluck down forms, windows, anything. Plebeians exit with Caesar’s body. Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot; Take thou what course thou wilt. Enter Servant. How now, fellow? Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome. Where is he? He and Lepidus are at Caesar’s house. And thither will I straight to visit him. He comes upon a wish. Fortune is merry And in this mood will give us anything. I heard him say Brutus and Cassius Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome. Belike they had some notice of the people How I had moved them. Bring me to Octavius. They exit.",
      "Alarum. Enter Brutus, Messala, Cato, Lucilius, and Flavius. Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads! Brutus, Messala, and Flavius exit. What bastard doth not? Who will go with me? I will proclaim my name about the field. I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho! A foe to tyrants and my country’s friend. I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho! Enter Soldiers and fight. And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I! Brutus, my country’s friend! Know me for Brutus. Cato is killed. O young and noble Cato, art thou down? Why, now thou diest as bravely as Titinius And mayst be honored, being Cato’s son. seizing Lucilius Yield, or thou diest. Only I yield to die. There is so much that thou wilt kill me straight. Offering money. Kill Brutus and be honored in his death. We must not. A noble prisoner! Enter Antony. Room, ho! Tell Antony Brutus is ta’en. I’ll tell the news. Here comes the General.— Brutus is ta’en, Brutus is ta’en, my lord. Where is he? Safe, Antony, Brutus is safe enough. I dare assure thee that no enemy Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus. The gods defend him from so great a shame! When you do find him, or alive or dead, He will be found like Brutus, like himself. This is not Brutus, friend, but I assure you, A prize no less in worth. Keep this man safe. Give him all kindness. I had rather have Such men my friends than enemies. Go on, And see whe’er Brutus be alive or dead, And bring us word unto Octavius’ tent How everything is chanced. They exit in different directions.",
      "Brutus attempts to justify Caesar's assassination by appealing to the plebeians' patriotism and fear of tyranny, prioritizing the good of Rome over personal loyalty. His appeal to reason and honor, however, is undermined by Antony's emotional manipulation, which stirs the crowd to mutiny by highlighting Caesar's virtues and their personal loss. Antony's calculated use of rhetoric, feigning reluctance while skillfully revealing Caesar's will and displaying his wounds, incites the plebeians to seek revenge, demonstrating the power of emotional appeals over rational arguments in swaying public opinion. The scene culminates in the complete reversal of public sentiment, setting the stage for further conflict and chaos as Antony seizes the opportunity to consolidate power.",
      "You shall, Mark Antony. Brutus, a word with you. Aside to Brutus. You know not what you do. Do not consent That Antony speak in his funeral. Know you how much the people may be moved By that which he will utter? aside to Cassius By your pardon, I will myself into the pulpit first And show the reason of our Caesar’s death. What Antony shall speak I will protest He speaks by leave and by permission, And that we are contented Caesar shall Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies. It shall advantage more than do us wrong. aside to Brutus I know not what may fall. I like it not. Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar’s body. You shall not in your funeral speech blame us But speak all good you can devise of Caesar And say you do ’t by our permission, Else shall you not have any hand at all About his funeral. And you shall speak In the same pulpit whereto I am going, After my speech is ended.",

O pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth, That I am meek and gentle with these butchers. Thou art the ruins of the noblest man That ever livèd in the tide of times. Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood! Over thy wounds now do I prophesy (Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue) A curse shall light upon the limbs of men; Domestic fury and fierce civil strife Shall cumber all the parts of Italy; Blood and destruction shall be so in use And dreadful objects so familiar That mothers shall but smile when they behold Their infants quartered with the hands of war, All pity choked with custom of fell deeds; And Caesar’s spirit, ranging for revenge, With Ate by his side come hot from hell, Shall in these confines with a monarch’s voice Cry “Havoc!” and let slip the dogs of war, That this foul deed shall smell above the earth With carrion men groaning for burial.",
      "Brutus, a word with you. Aside to Brutus. You know not what you do. Do not consent That Antony speak in his funeral. Know you how much the people may be moved By that which he will utter?",
      "Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears. I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him. The evil that men do lives after them; The good is oft interrèd with their bones. So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus Hath told you Caesar was ambitious. If it were so, it was a grievous fault, And grievously hath Caesar answered it. Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest (For Brutus is an honorable man; So are they all, all honorable men), Come I to speak in Caesar’s funeral. He was my friend, faithful and just to me, But Brutus says he was ambitious, And Brutus is an honorable man. He hath brought many captives home to Rome, Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill. Did this in Caesar seem ambitious? When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept; Ambition should be made of sterner stuff. Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, And Brutus is an honorable man. You all did see that on the Lupercal I thrice presented him a kingly crown, Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition? Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, And sure he is an honorable man. I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, But here I am to speak what I do know. You all did love him once, not without cause. What cause withholds you, then, to mourn for him?— O judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, And men have lost their reason!—Bear with me; My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar, And I must pause till it come back to me. He weeps."

    "ground_truth": "Brutus appeals to logic and honor with plain prose, while Antony uses emotional rhetoric, irony, and Caesar's will to turn the crowd against the conspirators",
    "answer": "The contrast between Brutus's and Antony's funeral speeches in Act 3, Scene 2 highlights the difference between appealing to reason and manipulating emotions. Brutus attempts to justify Caesar's death through logic and patriotism, while Antony uses rhetoric and emotional appeals to incite the plebeians to mutiny. Brutus prioritizes the good of Rome and appeals to the plebeians' sense of honor. In contrast, Antony emphasizes Caesar's virtues, displays his wounds, and reads his will to stir the crowd's grief and anger. This leads to a complete reversal of public sentiment against Brutus and the conspirators."

      "Enter Caesar, Antony for the course, Calphurnia, Portia, Decius, Cicero, Brutus, Cassius, Casca, a Soothsayer; after them Marullus and Flavius and Commoners. Calphurnia. Peace, ho! Caesar speaks. Calphurnia. Here, my lord. Stand you directly in Antonius’ way When he doth run his course.—Antonius. Caesar, my lord. Forget not in your speed, Antonius, To touch Calphurnia, for our elders say The barren, touchèd in this holy chase, Shake off their sterile curse. I shall remember. When Caesar says “Do this,” it is performed. Set on and leave no ceremony out. Sennet. Caesar. Ha! Who calls? Bid every noise be still. Peace, yet again! Who is it in the press that calls on me? I hear a tongue shriller than all the music Cry “Caesar.” Speak. Caesar is turned to hear. Beware the ides of March. What man is that? A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March. Set him before me. Let me see his face. Fellow, come from the throng. The Soothsayer comes forward. Look upon Caesar. What sayst thou to me now? Speak once again. Beware the ides of March. He is a dreamer. Let us leave him. Pass. Sennet. All but Brutus and Cassius exit. Will you go see the order of the course? Not I. I pray you, do. I am not gamesome. I do lack some part Of that quick spirit that is in Antony. Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires. I’ll leave you. Brutus, I do observe you now of late. I have not from your eyes that gentleness And show of love as I was wont to have. You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand Over your friend that loves you. Cassius, Be not deceived. If I have veiled my look, I turn the trouble of my countenance Merely upon myself. Vexèd I am Of late with passions of some difference, Conceptions only proper to myself, Which give some soil, perhaps, to my behaviors. But let not therefore my good friends be grieved (Among which number, Cassius, be you one) Nor construe any further my neglect Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war, Forgets the shows of love to other men. Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion, By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations. Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face? No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself But by reflection, by some other things. ’Tis just. And it is very much lamented, Brutus, That you have no such mirrors as will turn Your hidden worthiness into your eye, That you might see your shadow. I have heard Where many of the best respect in Rome, Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus And groaning underneath this age’s yoke, Have wished that noble Brutus had his eyes. Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius, That you would have me seek into myself For that which is not in me? Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear. And since you know you cannot see yourself So well as by reflection, I, your glass, Will modestly discover to yourself That of yourself which you yet know not of. And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus. Were I a common laughter, or did use To stale with ordinary oaths my love To every new protester; if you know That I do fawn on men and hug them hard And after scandal them, or if you know That I profess myself in banqueting To all the rout, then hold me dangerous. Flourish and shout. What means this shouting? I do fear the people Choose Caesar for their king. Ay, do you fear it? Then must I think you would not have it so. I would not, Cassius, yet I love him well. But wherefore do you hold me here so long? What is it that you would impart to me? If it be aught toward the general good, Set honor in one eye and death i’ th’ other And I will look on both indifferently; For let the gods so speed me as I love The name of honor more than I fear death. I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus, As well as I do know your outward favor. Well, honor is the subject of my story. I cannot tell what you and other men Think of this life; but, for my single self, I had as lief not be as live to be In awe of such a thing as I myself. I was born free as Caesar; so were you; We both have fed as well, and we can both Endure the winter’s cold as well as he. For once, upon a raw and gusty day, The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores, Caesar said to me “Dar’st thou, Cassius, now Leap in with me into this angry flood And swim to yonder point?” Upon the word, Accoutered as I was, I plungèd in And bade him follow; so indeed he did. The torrent roared, and we did buffet it With lusty sinews, throwing it aside And stemming it with hearts of controversy. But ere we could arrive the point proposed, Caesar cried “Help me, Cassius, or I sink!” as Aeneas, our great ancestor, Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber Did I the tired Caesar. And this man Is now become a god, and Cassius is A wretched creature and must bend his body If Caesar carelessly but nod on him. He had a fever when he was in Spain, And when the fit was on him, I did mark How he did shake. ’Tis true, this god did shake. His coward lips did from their color fly, And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world Did lose his luster. I did hear him groan. Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans Mark him and write his speeches in their books, “Alas,” it cried “Give me some drink, Titinius” As a sick girl. You gods, it doth amaze me A man of such a feeble temper should So get the start of the majestic world And bear the palm alone. Shout. Flourish. Another general shout! I do believe that these applauses are For some new honors that are heaped on Caesar. Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world Like a Colossus, and we petty men Walk under his huge legs and peep about To find ourselves dishonorable graves. Men at some time are masters of their fates. The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, But in ourselves, that we are underlings. “Brutus” and “Caesar”—what should be in that “Caesar”? Why should that name be sounded more than yours? Write them together, yours is as fair a name; Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well; Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with ’em, “Brutus” will start a spirit as soon as “Caesar.” Now, in the names of all the gods at once, Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed! Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods! When went there by an age, since the great flood, But it was famed with more than with one man? When could they say, till now, that talked of Rome, That her wide walks encompassed but one man? Now is it Rome indeed, and room enough When there is in it but one only man. you and I have heard our fathers say There was a Brutus once that would have brooked Th’ eternal devil to keep his state in Rome As easily as a king. That you do love me, I am nothing jealous. What you would work me to, I have some aim. How I have thought of this, and of these times, I shall recount hereafter. For this present, I would not, so with love I might entreat you, Be any further moved. What you have said I will consider; what you have to say I will with patience hear, and find a time Both meet to hear and answer such high things. Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this: Brutus had rather be a villager Than to repute himself a son of Rome Under these hard conditions as this time Is like to lay upon us. I am glad that my weak words Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus. Enter Caesar and his train. The games are done, and Caesar is returning. As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve, And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you What hath proceeded worthy note today. I will do so. But look you, Cassius, The angry spot doth glow on Caesar’s brow, And all the rest look like a chidden train. Calphurnia’s cheek is pale, and Cicero Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes As we have seen him in the Capitol, Being crossed in conference by some senators. Casca will tell us what the matter is. Antonius. Caesar. Let me have men about me that are fat, Sleek-headed men, and such as sleep a-nights. Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look. He thinks too much. Such men are dangerous. Fear him not, Caesar; he’s not dangerous. He is a noble Roman, and well given. Would he were fatter! But I fear him not. Yet if my name were liable to fear, I do not know the man I should avoid So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much, He is a great observer, and he looks Quite through the deeds of men. He loves no plays, As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music; Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort As if he mocked himself and scorned his spirit That could be moved to smile at anything. Such men as he be never at heart’s ease Whiles they behold a greater than themselves, And therefore are they very dangerous. I rather tell thee what is to be feared Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar. Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf, And tell me truly what thou think’st of him. Sennet. Caesar and his train exit but Casca remains behind. You pulled me by the cloak. Would you speak with me? Ay, Casca. Tell us what hath chanced today That Caesar looks so sad. Why, you were with him, were you not? I should not then ask Casca what had chanced. Why, there was a crown offered him; and, being offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand, thus, and then the people fell a-shouting. What was the second noise for? Why, for that too. They shouted thrice. What was the last cry for? Why, for that too. Was the crown offered him thrice? Ay, marry, was ’t, and he put it by thrice, every time gentler than other; and at every putting-by, mine honest neighbors shouted. Who offered him the crown? Why, Antony. Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca. I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it. It was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown (yet ’twas not a crown neither; ’twas one of these coronets), and, as I told you, he put it by once; but for all that, to my thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he offered it to him again; then he put it by again; but to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it. And then he offered it the third time. He put it the third time by, and still as he refused it the rabblement hooted and clapped their chopped hands and threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked Caesar, for he swooned and fell down at it. And for mine own part, I durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air. But soft, I pray you. What, did Caesar swoon? He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and was speechless. ’Tis very like; he hath the falling sickness. No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness. I know not what you mean by that, but I am sure Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and displeased them, as they use to do the players in the theater, I am no true man. What said he when he came unto himself? Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common herd was glad he refused the crown, he plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his throat to cut. An I had been a man of any occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word, I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so he fell. When he came to himself again, he said if he had done or said anything amiss, he desired their Worships to think it was his infirmity. Three or four wenches where I stood cried “Alas, good soul!” and forgave him with all their hearts. But there’s no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less. And, after that, he came thus sad away? Ay. Did Cicero say anything? Ay, he spoke Greek. To what effect? Nay, an I tell you that, I’ll ne’er look you i’ th’ face again. But those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads. But for mine own part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarves off Caesar’s images, are put to silence. Fare you well. There was more foolery yet, if I could remember it. Will you sup with me tonight, Casca? No, I am promised forth. Will you dine with me tomorrow? Ay, if I be alive, and your mind hold, and your dinner worth the eating. Good. I will expect you. Do so. Farewell both. He exits. What a blunt fellow is this grown to be! He was quick mettle when he went to school. So is he now in execution Of any bold or noble enterprise, However he puts on this tardy form. This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit, Which gives men stomach to digest his words With better appetite. And so it is. For this time I will leave you. Tomorrow, if you please to speak with me, I will come home to you; or, if you will, Come home to me, and I will wait for you. I will do so. Till then, think of the world. Brutus exits. Well, Brutus, thou art noble. Yet I see Thy honorable mettle may be wrought From that it is disposed. Therefore it is meet That noble minds keep ever with their likes; For who so firm that cannot be seduced? Caesar doth bear me hard, but he loves Brutus. If I were Brutus now, and he were Cassius, He should not humor me. I will this night In several hands in at his windows throw, As if they came from several citizens, Writings, all tending to the great opinion That Rome holds of his name, wherein obscurely Caesar’s ambition shall be glancèd at And after this, let Caesar seat him sure, For we will shake him, or worse days endure. He exits.",
      "Flourish. Enter Caesar, Antony, Lepidus; Brutus, Cassius, Casca, Decius, Metellus, Trebonius, Cinna; Publius, Popilius, Artemidorus, the Soothsayer, and other Senators and Petitioners. The ides of March are come. SOOTHSAYER Ay, Caesar, but not gone. ARTEMIDORUS Hail, Caesar. Read this schedule. Trebonius doth desire you to o’erread, At your best leisure, this his humble suit. O Caesar, read mine first, for mine’s a suit That touches Caesar nearer. Read it, great Caesar. What touches us ourself shall be last served. Delay not, Caesar; read it instantly. What, is the fellow mad? Sirrah, give place. What, urge you your petitions in the street? Come to the Capitol. Caesar goes forward, the rest following. to Cassius I wish your enterprise today may thrive. What enterprise, Popilius? Fare you well. He walks away. What said Popilius Lena? He wished today our enterprise might thrive. I fear our purpose is discoverèd. Look how he makes to Caesar. Mark him. Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention.— Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known, Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back, For I will slay myself. Cassius, be constant. Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes, For look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change. Trebonius knows his time, for look you, Brutus, He draws Mark Antony out of the way. Trebonius and Antony exit. Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him go And presently prefer his suit to Caesar. He is addressed. Press near and second him. Casca, you are the first that rears your hand. Are we all ready? What is now amiss That Caesar and his Senate must redress? kneeling Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar, Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat An humble heart. I must prevent thee, Cimber. These couchings and these lowly courtesies Might fire the blood of ordinary men And turn preordinance and first decree Into the law of children. Be not fond To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood That will be thawed from the true quality With that which melteth fools—I mean sweet words, Low-crookèd curtsies, and base spaniel fawning. Thy brother by decree is banishèd. If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him, I spurn thee like a cur out of my way. Know: Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause Will he be satisfied. Is there no voice more worthy than my own To sound more sweetly in great Caesar’s ear For the repealing of my banished brother? kneeling I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar, Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may Have an immediate freedom of repeal. What, Brutus? kneeling Pardon, Caesar; Caesar, pardon! As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber. I could be well moved, if I were as you. If I could pray to move, prayers would move me. But I am constant as the Northern Star, Of whose true fixed and resting quality There is no fellow in the firmament. The skies are painted with unnumbered sparks; They are all fire, and every one doth shine. But there’s but one in all doth hold his place. So in the world: ’tis furnished well with men, And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive. Yet in the number I do know but one That unassailable holds on his rank, Unshaked of motion; and that I am he Let me a little show it, even in this: That I was constant Cimber should be banished And constant do remain to keep him so. kneeling O Caesar— Hence. Wilt thou lift up Olympus? kneeling Great Caesar— Doth not Brutus bootless kneel? Speak, hands, for me! As Casca strikes, the others rise up and stab Caesar. Et tu, Brutè?—Then fall, Caesar. He dies. Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead! Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets. Some to the common pulpits and cry out “Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement.” People and Senators, be not affrighted. Fly not; stand still. Ambition’s debt is paid. Go to the pulpit, Brutus. And Cassius too. Where’s Publius? Here, quite confounded with this mutiny. Stand fast together, lest some friend of Caesar’s Should chance— Talk not of standing.—Publius, good cheer. There is no harm intended to your person, Nor to no Roman else. So tell them, Publius. And leave us, Publius, lest that the people, Rushing on us, should do your age some mischief. Do so, and let no man abide this deed But we the doers. All but the Conspirators exit. Enter Trebonius. Where is Antony? TREBONIUS Fled to his house amazed. Men, wives, and children stare, cry out, and run As it were doomsday. BRUTUS Fates, we will know your pleasures. That we shall die we know; ’tis but the time, And drawing days out, that men stand upon. Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life Cuts off so many years of fearing death. Grant that, and then is death a benefit. So are we Caesar’s friends, that have abridged His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop, And let us bathe our hands in Caesar’s blood Up to the elbows and besmear our swords. Then walk we forth, even to the marketplace, And, waving our red weapons o’er our heads, Let’s all cry “Peace, freedom, and liberty!” Stoop then, and wash. They smear their hands and swords with Caesar’s blood. How many ages hence Shall this our lofty scene be acted over In states unborn and accents yet unknown! How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport, That now on Pompey’s basis lies along No worthier than the dust! So oft as that shall be, So often shall the knot of us be called The men that gave their country liberty. What, shall we forth? Ay, every man away. Brutus shall lead, and we will grace his heels With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome. Enter a Servant. Soft, who comes here? A friend of Antony’s. kneeling Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel. Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down, And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say: Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest; Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving. Say, I love Brutus, and I honor him; Say, I feared Caesar, honored him, and loved him. If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony May safely come to him and be resolved How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death, Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead So well as Brutus living, but will follow The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus Thorough the hazards of this untrod state With all true faith. So says my master Antony. Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman. I never thought him worse. Tell him, so please him come unto this place, He shall be satisfied and, by my honor, Depart untouched. I’ll fetch him presently. Servant exits. I know that we shall have him well to friend. I wish we may; but yet have I a mind That fears him much, and my misgiving still Falls shrewdly to the purpose. Enter Antony. But here comes Antony.—Welcome, Mark Antony! O mighty Caesar, dost thou lie so low? Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.— I know not, gentlemen, what you intend, Who else must be let blood, who else is rank. If I myself, there is no hour so fit As Caesar’s death’s hour, nor no instrument Of half that worth as those your swords made rich With the most noble blood of all this world. I do beseech you, if you bear me hard, Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke, Fulfill your pleasure. Live a thousand years, I shall not find myself so apt to die; No place will please me so, no mean of death, As here by Caesar, and by you cut off, The choice and master spirits of this age. O Antony, beg not your death of us! Though now we must appear bloody and cruel, As by our hands and this our present act You see we do, yet see you but our hands And this the bleeding business they have done. Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful; And pity to the general wrong of Rome (As fire drives out fire, so pity pity) Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part, To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony. Our arms in strength of malice, and our hearts Of brothers’ temper, do receive you in With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence. Your voice shall be as strong as any man’s In the disposing of new dignities. Only be patient till we have appeased The multitude, beside themselves with fear; And then we will deliver you the cause Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him, Have thus proceeded. I doubt not of your wisdom. Let each man render me his bloody hand. First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you.— Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand.— Now, Decius Brutus, yours;—now yours, Metellus;— Yours, Cinna;—and, my valiant Casca, yours;— Though last, not least in love, yours, good Trebonius.— Gentlemen all—alas, what shall I say? My credit now stands on such slippery ground That one of two bad ways you must conceit me, Either a coward or a flatterer.— That I did love thee, Caesar, O, ’tis true! If then thy spirit look upon us now, Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death To see thy Antony making his peace, Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes— Most noble!—in the presence of thy corpse? Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds, Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood, It would become me better than to close In terms of friendship with thine enemies. Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bayed, brave hart, Here didst thou fall, and here thy hunters stand Signed in thy spoil and crimsoned in thy Lethe. O world, thou wast the forest to this hart, And this indeed, O world, the heart of thee. How like a deer strucken by many princes Dost thou here lie! Mark Antony— Pardon me, Caius Cassius. The enemies of Caesar shall say this; Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty. I blame you not for praising Caesar so. But what compact mean you to have with us? Will you be pricked in number of our friends, Or shall we on and not depend on you? Therefore I took your hands, but was indeed Swayed from the point by looking down on Caesar. Friends am I with you all and love you all, Upon this hope, that you shall give me reasons Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous. Or else were this a savage spectacle. Our reasons are so full of good regard That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar, You should be satisfied. That’s all I seek; And am, moreover, suitor that I may Produce his body to the marketplace, And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend, Speak in the order of his funeral. You shall, Mark Antony. Brutus, a word with you. Aside to Brutus. You know not what you do. Do not consent That Antony speak in his funeral. Know you how much the people may be moved By that which he will utter? aside to Cassius By your pardon, I will myself into the pulpit first And show the reason of our Caesar’s death. What Antony shall speak I will protest He speaks by leave and by permission, And that we are contented Caesar shall Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies. It shall advantage more than do us wrong. aside to Brutus I know not what may fall. I like it not. Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar’s body. You shall not in your funeral speech blame us But speak all good you can devise of Caesar And say you do ’t by our permission, Else shall you not have any hand at all About his funeral. And you shall speak In the same pulpit whereto I am going, After my speech is ended. Be it so. I do desire no more. Prepare the body, then, and follow us. All but Antony exit. O pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth, That I am meek and gentle with these butchers. Thou art the ruins of the noblest man That ever livèd in the tide of times. Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood! Over thy wounds now do I prophesy (Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue) A curse shall light upon the limbs of men; Domestic fury and fierce civil strife Shall cumber all the parts of Italy; Blood and destruction shall be so in use And dreadful objects so familiar That mothers shall but smile when they behold Their infants quartered with the hands of war, All pity choked with custom of fell deeds; And Caesar’s spirit, ranging for revenge, With Ate by his side come hot from hell, Shall in these confines with a monarch’s voice Cry “Havoc!” and let slip the dogs of war, That this foul deed shall smell above the earth With carrion men groaning for burial. Enter Octavius’ Servant. You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not? do, Mark Antony. Caesar did write for him to come to Rome. He did receive his letters and is coming, And bid me say to you by word of mouth— O Caesar! Thy heart is big. Get thee apart and weep. Passion, I see, is catching, for mine eyes, Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine, Began to water. Is thy master coming? He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome. Post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced. Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome, No Rome of safety for Octavius yet. Hie hence and tell him so.—Yet stay awhile; Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corpse Into the marketplace. There shall I try, In my oration, how the people take The cruel issue of these bloody men, According to the which thou shalt discourse To young Octavius of the state of things. Lend me your hand. They exit with Caesar’s body.",
      "Cato's defiant self-proclamation as a foe to tyrants, motivated by familial honor and patriotic fervor, underscores the ideological stakes of the battle. Lucilius's willingness to impersonate Brutus, offering himself for death, highlights the depth of loyalty and self-sacrifice within Brutus's ranks. Antony's assurance that Brutus will be found \"like himself,\" whether alive or dead, suggests an understanding of Brutus's unwavering commitment to his principles, even in defeat. The captors' inability to kill Lucilius, despite the offered reward, reveals a lingering respect for nobility and honor, complicating the political landscape. Antony's desire to have such men as friends rather than enemies indicates a pragmatic approach to consolidating power, recognizing the value of loyalty and integrity even in those who opposed him.",
      "Brutus attempts to justify Caesar's assassination by appealing to the plebeians' patriotism and fear of tyranny, prioritizing the good of Rome over personal loyalty. His appeal to reason and honor, however, is undermined by Antony's emotional manipulation, which stirs the crowd to mutiny by highlighting Caesar's virtues and their personal loss. Antony's calculated use of rhetoric, feigning reluctance while skillfully revealing Caesar's will and displaying his wounds, incites the plebeians to seek revenge, demonstrating the power of emotional appeals over rational arguments in swaying public opinion. The scene culminates in the complete reversal of public sentiment, setting the stage for further conflict and chaos as Antony seizes the opportunity to consolidate power.",

Thou hast wronged Caius Ligarius. There is but one mind in all these men, and it is bent against Caesar. If thou beest not immortal, look about you. Security gives way to conspiracy. The mighty gods defend thee! Thy lover, Artemidorus Here will I stand till Caesar pass along, And as a suitor will I give him this. My heart laments that virtue cannot live Out of the teeth of emulation. If thou read this, O Caesar, thou mayest live; If not, the Fates with traitors do contrive. He exits. Enter Portia and Lucius.

      "It must be by his death. And for my part I know no personal cause to spurn at him, But for the general. He would be crowned: How that might change his nature, there’s the question. It is the bright day that brings forth the adder, And that craves wary walking. Crown him that, And then I grant we put a sting in him That at his will he may do danger with. Th’ abuse of greatness is when it disjoins Remorse from power. And, to speak truth of Caesar, I have not known when his affections swayed More than his reason. But ’tis a common proof That lowliness is young ambition’s ladder, Whereto the climber-upward turns his face; But, when he once attains the upmost round, He then unto the ladder turns his back, Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees By which he did ascend. So Caesar may. Then, lest he may, prevent. And since the quarrel Will bear no color for the thing he is, Fashion it thus: that what he is, augmented, Would run to these and these extremities. And therefore think him as a serpent’s egg, Which, hatched, would, as his kind, grow mischievous, And kill him in the shell."

    "ground_truth": "Caesar publicly projects invincibility and constancy but privately reveals superstition and physical weakness, showing the conflict between his political image and human vulnerability",
    "answer": "Caesar's public image and private vulnerabilities are sharply contrasted. Publicly, Caesar strives to project an image of invulnerability and unwavering strength (Act 3, Scene 1). He declares himself \"constant as the Northern Star,\" unyielding to pleas or flattery. However, Cassius recounts Caesar's private moments of weakness, such as his fever in Spain where he \"did shake\" and cried for drink \"as a sick girl\" (Act 1, Scene 2). Furthermore, Casca reveals that Caesar swooned in the marketplace (Act 1, Scene 2), indicating a physical frailty that contradicts his carefully constructed public persona."

    "contexts": [
      "Cassius, driven by a fatalistic belief that his life has come full circle, misinterprets events due to his failing eyesight and orders Pindarus to kill him, showcasing his impulsiveness and despair. Titinius's subsequent suicide upon discovering Cassius's death reveals the depth of their loyalty and the devastating impact of misinformation and perceived defeat. Brutus's stoic reaction to the deaths, focusing on strategic concerns rather than overt grief, highlights his commitment to the cause above personal emotions, even as he acknowledges the profound loss. The scene underscores the themes of misinterpretation, loyalty, and the tragic consequences of war, where personal bonds are sacrificed for political ideals. The political tension is heightened by the impending second battle, emphasizing the relentless nature of the conflict and the characters' determination to fight to the end.",
      "Brutus's urgent command to Messala reveals his strategic thinking and belief in a swift victory. His perception of \"cold demeanor\" in Octavius's forces fuels his motivation to exploit a perceived weakness, highlighting his continued underestimation of his opponents. This decision, driven by a potentially flawed assessment, underscores the theme of misjudgment that plagues the conspirators. The immediate consequence of this order is a full-scale attack, escalating the political tension and setting the stage for the final, decisive battle.",

      "Enter Brutus, Dardanus, Clitus, Strato, and Volumnius. Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock. He sits down. Statilius showed the torchlight, but, my lord, He came not back. He is or ta’en or slain. Sit thee down, Clitus. Slaying is the word; It is a deed in fashion. Hark thee, Clitus. He whispers to Clitus. What, I, my lord? No, not for all the world. Peace, then, no words. I’ll rather kill myself. Hark thee, Dardanus. He whispers to Dardanus. Shall I do such a deed? O Dardanus! O Clitus! Dardanus and Clitus step aside. What ill request did Brutus make to thee? To kill him, Clitus. Look, he meditates. Now is that noble vessel full of grief, That it runs over even at his eyes. Come hither, good Volumnius. List a word. What says my lord? Why this, Volumnius: The ghost of Caesar hath appeared to me Two several times by night—at Sardis once And this last night here in Philippi fields. I know my hour is come. Not so, my lord. Nay, I am sure it is, Volumnius. Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes. Our enemies have beat us to the pit. Low alarums. It is more worthy to leap in ourselves Than tarry till they push us. Good Volumnius, Thou know’st that we two went to school together; Even for that our love of old, I prithee, Hold thou my sword hilts whilst I run on it. That’s not an office for a friend, my lord. Alarum continues. Fly, fly, my lord! There is no tarrying here. Farewell to you—and you—and you, Volumnius.— Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep. Farewell to thee, too, Strato.—Countrymen, My heart doth joy that yet in all my life I found no man but he was true to me. I shall have glory by this losing day More than Octavius and Mark Antony By this vile conquest shall attain unto. So fare you well at once, for Brutus’ tongue Hath almost ended his life’s history. Night hangs upon mine eyes; my bones would rest, That have but labored to attain this hour. Alarum. Cry within “Fly, fly, fly!” Fly, my lord, fly! Hence. I will follow. All exit but Brutus and Strato. I prithee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord. Thou art a fellow of a good respect; Thy life hath had some smatch of honor in it. Hold, then, my sword, and turn away thy face While I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato? Give me your hand first. Fare you well, my lord. Farewell, good Strato. Brutus runs on his sword. Caesar, now be still. I killed not thee with half so good a will. He dies. Alarum. Retreat. Enter Antony, Octavius, Messala, Lucilius, and the army. What man is that? My master’s man.—Strato, where is thy master? Free from the bondage you are in, Messala. The conquerors can but make a fire of him, For Brutus only overcame himself, And no man else hath honor by his death. So Brutus should be found.—I thank thee, Brutus, That thou hast proved Lucilius’ saying true. All that served Brutus, I will entertain them.— Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me? Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you. Do so, good Messala. How died my master, Strato? I held the sword, and he did run on it. Octavius, then take him to follow thee, That did the latest service to my master. This was the noblest Roman of them all. All the conspirators save only he Did that they did in envy of great Caesar. He only in a general honest thought And common good to all made one of them. His life was gentle and the elements So mixed in him that nature might stand up And say to all the world “This was a man.” According to his virtue, let us use him With all respect and rites of burial. Within my tent his bones tonight shall lie, Most like a soldier, ordered honorably. So call the field to rest, and let’s away To part the glories of this happy day. They all exit.",
